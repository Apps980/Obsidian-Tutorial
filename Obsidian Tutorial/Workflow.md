# Finding an article
An absolutely fantastic tool for finding research articles is [Elicit.com](https://elicit.com/). It is an AI tool to find research articles. Simply enter a question and the search engine will try and find articles to answer your question.

Elicit will generate a summary of the top papers, as well as an abstract summary for each article. This makes finding relevant articles much faster.

# Zotero
Once you've found an article, use the zotero browser extension to save it. Make sure it also saves the PDF or add it manually.

>[!tip]
>You can use emojis as tags to mark which articles are unread. For example: ✔(read & useful), ⌛(unread), ❌ (read & not useful)

In Zotero, you can view and annotate PDFs. Read through the article and annotate as needed. You can highlight, add comments, take screenshots, etc.

I've set the template so that different highlighter colours mean different things:
![[Highlight Colours]]

You can change these in the [[Zotero Template]] file, under annotations.

# Obsidian

>[!caution]
>Importing notes overwrites any previously existing note of the same name. If you have written comments in a note, consider making a backup.
>

Pressing 'Ctrl +P', you can bring up the command palette. From here, you can access the various functions in Obsidian. Search for 'Create Literature Note'. Zotero should open and you can look up article names in the same manner as you would to cite in a word document.

You should now have a file in 'Sources' with the article's citekey. Have a look through that note. 
>If you have any snipped images, a folder should appear in 'Images' but the images can also be found in the newly created note.

We have now imported the annotations from Zotero. Hurrah! Follow the same steps for all subsequent articles.

# The point of no return

>[!warning] 
>Seriously, if you import again, **ALL** of the additional comments made in Obsidian will be overwritten. 

Once you have completely annotated your file and are **ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN** that you will not need to re-import the note, feel free to populate the note with additional comments. If certain topics are regularly brought up, use `[[brackets]]` to create notes for those topics. Tags (using `#TagName`) is an effective way of filtering through articles by keywords. 

Once you're done, put the main findings in the 'Synthesis' block at the beginning of the note.

>[!info] 
>If you need to cite another article, you can also use single brackets for in-line citations (e.g. [(at)yuan2021]=[@yuan2021] ). This will require some tinkering in the 'Zotero Integration' and 'Pandoc reference list' plugins.

# Synthesis
Once you have read and annotated several articles, you may find yourself a bit overwhelmed with the number of notes you have. A great way to organize your notes is with an index. Check out the [[Index]] note in 'Example Project'.

And we're done! This is how I've started using Obsidian to annotate and synthesize research articles in an organized and effective manner.
