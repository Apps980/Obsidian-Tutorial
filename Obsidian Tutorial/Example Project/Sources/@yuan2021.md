> It has been commonly observed on open waters that ducklings/goslings follow their mothers in a highly organized formation. The questions arise: (1) why are they swimming in formation? (2) what is the best swimming formation? (3) how much energy can be preserved by each individual in formation swimming? To address these questions, we established a simplified mathematical and numerical model and calculated the wave drag on a group of waterfowl in a swimming formation. We observed two new and interesting findings: wave-riding and wave-passing. By riding the waves generated by a mother duck, a trailing duckling can obtain a significant wave-drag reduction. When a duckling swims at the ‘sweet point’ behind its mother, a destructive wave interference phenomenon occurs and the wave drag of the duckling turns positive, pushing the duckling forward. More interestingly, this wave-riding benefit could be sustained by the rest of the ducklings in a single-file line formation. Starting from the third one in a queue, the wave drag of individuals gradually tended towards zero, and a delicate dynamic equilibrium was achieved. Each individual under that equilibrium acted as a wave passer, passing the waves’ energy to its trailing one without any energy losses. Wave-riding and wave-passing are probably the principal reasons for the evolution of swimming formation by waterfowl. This study is the first to reveal the reasons why the formation movement of waterfowl can preserve individuals’ energy expenditure. Our calculations provide new insights into the mechanisms of formation swimming.

> The total drag of a surface-piercing moving body is composed of two primary components: wave drag and viscous drag.

> The difference in viscous drag between a duckling swimming in formation and the same duckling swimming independently at the same speed is assumed to be small.

> It is assumed the waterfowl can instinctively find and stay in a position of minimum drag without considering the other group members’ locomotion performance.

> Young waterfowl are commonly observed to swim in formation on the free water surface (as shown in figure 1a), which is the interface between the air and water.

> It should be noted that the benefit received from the waves can only be sustained when the relative position of the duckling to the wave remains unchanged. It requires that the duckling’s forward speed must be equal to the group velocity of the wave.

> An alternative selection for the duckling would be swimming in front of the mother duck (on her bow wave).

> However, the side effects are obvious. Regardless of the social behaviour (e.g. protection against predators), the wave energy to be potentially utilized is relatively small. The duckling will only benefit from a small ‘pushing’ force when it gets very close to its mother’s breast.
