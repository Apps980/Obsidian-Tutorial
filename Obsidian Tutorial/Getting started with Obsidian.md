# Preamble
From post-its, to notebooks, to .txt and word files, I've seen many ways people annotate and process research articles. Problems arise when you need to manage the notes from many different articles, for example when undertaking a literature review. My greatest challenge was organizing and making connections between articles.

Enter **OBSIDIAN**, a fantastic tool that helped me tackle those two challenges. While Obsidian is great for note-taking, it is incredibly flexible thanks to community plugins that bring in features such as daily planners, mind maps, and so much more. For the purpose of today's tutorial, I'll focus on a workflow for processing research articles, taking notes, linking notes, and finally how to write using this software.

# But first, why Obsidian?
There are many reasons to use obsidian, but here are a couple good reasons:
- Obsidian is **FREE**
	- No limitations on quantity of notes, no ads, nothing
	- The paid versions allow syncing between computers but there are a couple ways around this
- Obsidian is **FAST**
	- Doesn't take much to run
	- Doesn't take much room on your PC
	- Doesn't need internet access
- Obsidian is **CLEAN**
	- Easy to use UI
	- No clutter
	- Infinitely customizable
- Obsidian is **FUTURE-PROOF**
	- Obsidian uses markdown, which is non-proprietary and will work on any computer or OS

There is also a mobile app for on-the-go use. Great ideas often come at inopportune times, so its nice to be able to jot them down somewhere before you forget.

# First steps!
You should all have obsidian downloaded. If you don't, please use the following QR code:

## Your first vault
The first time you open the app, it will ask you to 'Create a new vault'. The vault is essentially the folder in which your notes will be stored in. Place the vault wherever you want it to be, give it a name, and click 'create'.

Voila! You've created your very first vault. Check out the 'Welcome' note and the graph view. I want  you to notice a couple things:
- With the arrow keys, navigate the cursor through the note. Notice how symbols are used.
- In the graph page, 'create a link' is greyed out. It is also greyed out in the note.

If you click on 'create a link', it will create a new note called 'create a link' and (quite obviously) create a link between 'Welcome' and the new note. Pretty cool right?

To create a new note, press the button in the top left (above the vault's name) or press 'Ctrl + N'. To link this new note to the 'Welcome' note, type `[[Welcome]]`.

>You can create links to future notes by `[[using brackets]]`. This will create a link but will not make a note until you click on it.

Sweet! We've successfully created our first notes and made links between them. Let's take a second here to make sure everything is set up before moving forward. In the meantime, try out the following syntax elements:

Headings: `# Heading 1, ## Heading 2, ### Heading 3`
**Bold**: `**Bold**`
*Italic*: `*Italic`
Lists:
1. Ordered lists: `1.`
- Unordered lists: `-`
- [ ] task lists: `- [ ] `
==highlight== : == highlight == (no spaces)

There is also a [[Markdown_Cheat_Sheet.pdf|Markdown Cheat Sheet]] in the repository with additional syntax elements. Useful to keep handy while getting familiar with Markdown's syntax.

That's it for the basics! Let's move on to [[Setting up the workflow]].
