# Zotero Integration
Download the 'Example Project.zip' file and export it to your vault.

In the 'Zotero integration' plugin's options, download the PDF utility, make sure the database is 'Zotero'. You will need to add a format for imported files. To do so, press 'Add Import Format' and enter the following information.

What this template will do is pull the reference's metadata and insert it into the note. The best part is that it will also pull highlighted text, images, comments and annotations made in the PDF.

>[!Tip] 
>You can edit the template to better suit your needs.
