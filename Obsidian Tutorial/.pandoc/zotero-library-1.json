  {"id":"albertiGlobalUrbanSignatures2017","abstract":"Humans challenge the phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of species by affecting the fitness landscapes on which they evolve. Recent studies show that cities might play a major role in contemporary evolution by accelerating phenotypic changes in wildlife, including animals, plants, fungi, and other organisms. Many studies of ecoevolutionary change have focused on anthropogenic drivers, but none of these studies has specifically examined the role that urbanization plays in ecoevolution or explicitly examined its mechanisms. This paper presents evidence on the mechanisms linking urban development patterns to rapid evolutionary changes for species that play important functional roles in communities and ecosystems. Through a metaanalysis of experimental and observational studies reporting more than 1,600 phenotypic changes in species across multiple regions, we ask whether we can discriminate an urban signature of phenotypic change beyond the established natural baselines and other anthropogenic signals. We then assess the relative impact of five types of urban disturbances including habitat modifications, biotic interactions, habitat heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and social interactions. Our study shows a clear urban signal; rates of phenotypic change are greater in urbanizing systems compared with natural and nonurban anthropogenic systems. By explicitly linking urban development to traits that affect ecosystem function, we can map potential ecoevolutionary implications of emerging patterns of urban agglomerations and uncover insights for maintaining key ecosystem functions upon which the sustainability of human well-being depends.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Alberti","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Correa","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."},{"family":"Hendry","given":"Andrew P."},{"family":"Palkovacs","given":"Eric P."},{"family":"Gotanda","given":"Kiyoko M."},{"family":"Hunt","given":"Victoria M."},{"family":"Apgar","given":"Travis M."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yuyu"}],"citation-key":"albertiGlobalUrbanSignatures2017","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1606034114","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"34","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,22]]},"language":"en","page":"8951-8956","PMID":"28049817","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Global urban signatures of phenotypic change in animal and plant populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/34/8951","volume":"114"},
  {"id":"aliceSentinelBehaviorSeasonality","abstract":"We investigated composition, annual cycle, site fidelity; foraging behavior of birds in mixed-speciesflocks, and the importance of sentinel behavior by the White-banded Tanager, Neothraupis fasciata, in a cerrado (savanna) near Brasilia, Brazil. Mixed-species flocks, comprising up to twenty-five resident, migratory, and transitory species, occurred in all months of the year, and were most frequent during the dry season,compared to the rainy season when breeding occurred and most specieswere absent or occasional in the flocks. The nuclear specieswere Whitebanded Tanager and Suiriri Flycatcher (Suiriri suirin), both residents with permanent territories. White-banded Tanagers showed sentinel behavior, performed by males and females usually one at a time. The intensity of the tanagers' sentinel behavior was significantly lower in mixed-species flocks compared to conspecific associations. This is consistent with the prediction that enhanced protection by other species resulted in lower requirements for vigilance by White-banded Tanagers. Sentinel behavior did not depend on group size, flock size or time of year. Most specieswere insectivorous. There was no evidence of convergence in foraging height or tactics among the three most frequent species.We suggestthat protection from predation is a major factor in the formation of mixed species flocks in cerrada Accepted 7 December 1995.","author":[{"family":"Alice","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Alves","given":"I.

However, comparative studies of urban biodiversity leading to robust generalities of the status and drivers of biodiversity in cities at the global scale are lacking. Here, we compiled the largest global dataset to date of two diverse taxa in cities: birds (54 cities) and plants (110 cities). We found that the majority of urban bird and plant species are native in the world's cities. Few plants and birds are cosmopolitan, the most common being Columba livia and Poa annua. The density of bird and plant species (the number of species per km2) has declined substantially: only 8% of native bird and 25% of native plant species are currently present compared with estimates of non-urban density of species. The current density of species in cities and the loss in density of species was best explained by anthropogenic features (landcover, city age) rather than by non-anthropogenic factors (geography, climate, topography). As urbanization continues to expand, efforts directed towards the conservation of intact vegetation within urban landscapes could support higher concentrations of both bird and plant species. Despite declines in the density of species, cities still retain endemic native species, thus providing opportunities for regional and global biodiversity conservation, restoration and education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Aronson","given":"Myla F.

  {"id":"baigrieInterspecificSignallingMutualists2014","abstract":"Interspecific communication is common in nature, particularly between mutualists. However, whether signals evolved for communication with other species, or are in fact conspecific signals eavesdropped upon by partners, is often unclear. Fork-tailed drongos (\n              Dicrurus adsimilis\n              ) associate with mixed-species groups and often produce true alarms at predators, whereupon associating species flee to cover, but also false alarms to steal associating species' food (kleptoparasitism). Despite such deception, associating species respond to drongo non-alarm calls by increasing their foraging and decreasing vigilance. Yet, whether these calls represent interspecific sentinel signals remains unknown. We show that drongos produced a specific sentinel call when foraging with a common associate, the sociable weaver (\n              Philetairus socius\n              ), but not when alone. Weavers increased their foraging and decreased vigilance when naturally associating with drongos, and in response to sentinel call playback. Further, drongos sentinel-called more often when weavers were moving, and weavers approached sentinel calls, suggesting a recruitment function. Finally, drongos sentinel-called when weavers fled following false alarms, thereby reducing disruption to weaver foraging time. Results therefore provide evidence of an ‘all clear’ signal that mitigates the cost of inaccurate communication. Our results suggest that drongos enhance exploitation of a foraging mutualist through coevolution of interspecific sentinel signals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Baigrie","given":"Bruce D."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Alex M."},{"family":"Flower","given":"Tom P."}],"citation-key":"baigrieInterspecificSignallingMutualists2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

Given that large groups often aggregate in areas of higher food density and that vigilance may be reduced when animals feed more, the group-size effect of vigilance may be confounded by the direct effect of food density on vigilance. In this paper, I examine the theoretical expectations regarding the effect of food density on vigilance and review the available empirical evidence. Two bodies of theory predict either no relationship or a negative relationship between vigilance and food density, but none has been tested explicitly. The empirical support for a negative relationship is mixed given that many studies actually document a positive correlation between vigilance and food density. I review the factors modulating the effect of food density on vigilance and show that there are several reasons to believe that the case against a confounding effect of food density is not as strong as expected. In fact, food density can actually mask the expected decrease in vigilance with group size.

Going back to Lotka-Volterra and optimal foraging theory, the theory about predation, including predator-prey population dynamics, was developed for solitary species. Various consequences of sociality for predators have been considered only recently. Similarly, while it was long recognized that prey species can benefit from living in groups, research on the adaptive value of sociality for prey species mostly emerged in the 1970s. The main theme of this book is the various ways that predators and prey may benefit from living in groups. The first part focusses on predators and explores how group membership influences predation success rate, from searching to subduing prey. The second part focusses on how prey in groups can detect and escape predators. The final section explores group size and composition and how individuals respond over evolutionary times to the challenges posed by chasing or being chased by animals in groups. This book will help the reader understand current issues in social predation theory and provide a synthesis of the literature across a broad range of animal taxa.

Although earlier literature reviews have provided ample support for this prediction, an increasing number of studies have failed to document a decline in vigilance with group size. In addition, support for this prediction has been based thus far on the P value of the relationship between vigilance and group size rather than on a quantitative assessment of effect magnitude. Here, I use a meta-analysis of empirical relationships between vigilance and group size in birds published in the last 35 years to provide a reassessment of the group-size effect on vigilance. Nearly one-third of all published relationships between vigilance and group size were not significant (n = 172). Results from the meta-analysis indicate weak to moderate negative correlations between group size and time spent vigilant (n = 43), scan frequency (n = 29), or scan duration (n = 20). The magnitude of the relationship was stronger in studies that controlled the amount of food available to birds. A funnel plot of the relationship between correlation coefficients and sample size failed to reveal an obvious publication bias. Although the meta-analysis results generally support the prediction that vigilance should decline with group size, a large amount of variation in vigilance remains unexplained in avian studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Beauchamp","given":"Guy"}],"citation-key":"beauchampWhatMagnitudeGroupsize2008","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","container-title-short":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/arn096","ISSN":"1045-2249","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",11,1]]},"page":"1361-1368","source":"Silverchair","title":"What is the magnitude of the group-size effect on vigilance?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arn096","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"bednekoffCoordinationSafeSelfish2001","abstract":"Sentinels are group members that watch from prominent positions. Sentinel interchanges often appear orderly and the number of sentinels changes little despite the turnover of individuals. I modeled why solitary individuals or group members might take up prominent positions. Such positions can be safe places to rest because they provide a good view of approaching predators, even if undetected predators preferentially attack sentinels. In pairs, coordinated sentinel behavior is favored whenever information spreads from a detecting to a non-detecting individual more than half the time. Under these conditions, safety for a sentinel produces safety for a forager as a by-product. Thus sentinel behavior occurs for selfish safety reasons but coordination of sentinels is based on mutualism. If sentinels can coordinate their individual actions, evidence of the game is hidden from view. The fitness consequences of some games may be best indicated by the strategies organisms take to avoid playing them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bednekoff","given":"Peter A."}],"citation-key":"bednekoffCoordinationSafeSelfish2001","container-title":"Annales Zoologici Fennici","ISSN":"0003-455X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"5-14","publisher":"Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board","source":"JSTOR","title":"Coordination of safe, selfish sentinels based on mutual benefits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23735746","volume":"38"},

If sentinel behavior involves a foraging–predation risk trade-oﬀ, animals should be sentinels more when fed supplemental food. When individual Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) were fed fragments of peanuts, during the following 30 min they shifted 30% of their time from foraging to sentinel behavior. In a follow-up experiment, we fed either one or two members in each group. As before, the jays reduced their foraging and spent much more time as sentinels when given supplemental food. In each treatment, pairs were sentinels simultaneously considerably less often than expected by chance. The dramatic shift from foraging to sentinel behavior suggests that for Florida scrub-jays sentinel behavior brings substantial beneﬁts for no greater cost than that of lost opportunities to forage. Because the results held for simple mated pairs of scrub-jays, we argue that kin selection and social prestige are not necessary to explain sentinel behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bednekoff","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Woolfenden","given":"Glen E."}],"citation-key":"bednekoffFloridaScrubjaysAphelocoma2003","container-title":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1046/j.0179-1613.2003.00926.x","ISSN":"01791613","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",11]]},"language":"en","page":"895-903","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Florida scrub-jays ( <i>Aphelocoma coerulescens</i> ) are sentinels more when well-fed (even with no kin nearby): sentinel behavior by Florida scrub-jays fed peanuts","title-short":"Florida scrub-jays ( <i>aphelocoma coerulescens</i> ) are sentinels more when well-fed (even with no kin nearby)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1046/j.0179-1613.2003.00926.x","volume":"109"},

  {"id":"bellValueConstantSurveillance2009","abstract":"In risky environments, where threats are unpredictable and the quality of information about threats is variable, all individuals face two fundamental challenges: balancing vigilance against other activities, and determining when to respond to warning signals. The solution to both is to obtain continuous estimates of background risk, enabling vigilance to be concentrated during the riskiest periods and informing about the likely cost of ignoring warnings. Human surveillance organizations routinely produce such estimates, frequently derived from indirect cues. Here we show that vigilant individuals in an animal society (the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor) perform a similar role. We ask (i) whether, in the absence of direct predator threats, pied babbler sentinels react to indirect information associated with increased risk and whether they communicate this information to group mates; (ii) whether group mates use this information to adjust their own vigilance, and whether this influences foraging success; and (iii) whether information provided by sentinels reduces the likelihood of inappropriate responses to alarm calls. Using playback experiments, we show that: (i) sentinels reacted to indirect predator cues (in the form of heterospecific alarm calls) by giving graded surveillance calls; (ii) foragers adjusted their vigilance in reaction to changes in surveillance calls, with substantial effects on foraging success; and (iii) foragers reduced their probability of responding to alarm calls when surveillance calls indicated lowered risk. These results demonstrate that identifying attacks as they occur is only part of vigilance: equally important is continuous surveillance providing information necessary for individuals to make decisions about their own vigilance and evasive action. Moreover, they suggest that a major benefit of group living is not only the increased likelihood of detecting threats, but a marked improvement in the quality of information available to each individual.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"M.

  {"id":"benmazouzCorvidsUrbanEnvironments2021","abstract":"Simple Summary\nWith regard to their high adaptability to human settlements and global distribution, corvid birds (crows, ravens, jays, etc.) are good models to understand the impacts of urbanization on wildlife. Here, we qualitatively reviewed the impacts of urbanization on corvids. At least 30 corvid species have become successfully accustomed or adapted to urbanized environments. The majority (72%, a total of 424 articles) of the studies reported positive effects of urbanization on corvids. The availability of easily accessible food and artificial nesting sites, coupled with low levels of predation, were found as the most important factors benefitting corvids in cities around the world. Studied topics ranged from population size and density, breeding biology and nesting site selection to control and management of Corvidae in cities. Despite biases in the distribution of the reviewed papers, our review attests that corvids have demonstrated high levels of adaptability to urban environments across space and time.\n\nAbstract\nUrbanization is one of the most prevalent drivers of biodiversity loss, yet few taxonomic groups are remarkably successful at adapting to urban environments. We systematically surveyed the global literature on the effects of urbanization on species of family Corvidae (crows, choughs, jackdaws, jays, magpies, nutcrackers, ravens, rooks, treepies) to assess the occurrence of corvids in urban environments and the factors affecting their success. We found a total of 424 primary research articles, and the number of articles has increased exponentially since the 1970s. Most studies were carried out in cities of Europe and North America (45.5% and 31.4%, respectively) and were directed on a single species (75.2). We found that 30 corvid species (23% of 133 total) regularly occur in urban environments. The majority (72%) of the studies reported positive effects of urbanization on corvids, with 85% of studies detecting population increases and 64% of studies detecting higher breeding success with urbanization. Of the factors proposed to explain corvids’ success (availability of nesting sites and food sources, low predation and persecution), food availability coupled with diet shifts emerged as the most important factors promoting Corvidae to live in urban settings. The breeding of corvids in urban environments was further associated with earlier nesting, similar or larger clutches, lower hatching but higher fledging success, reduced home range size and limited territoriality, increased tolerance towards humans and increasing frequency of conflicts with humans. Despite geographic and taxonomic biases in our literature sample, our review indicates that corvids show both flexibility in resource use and behavioral plasticity that enable them to exploit novel resources for nesting and feeding. Corvids can thus be urban exploiters of the large-scale modifications of ecosystems caused by urbanization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Benmazouz","given":"Isma"},{"family":"Jokimäki","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Lengyel","given":"Szabolcs"},{"family":"Juhász","given":"Lajos"},{"family":"Kaisanlahti-Jokimäki","given":"Marja-Liisa"},{"family":"Kardos","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Paládi","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Kövér","given":"László"}],"citation-key":"benmazouzCorvidsUrbanEnvironments2021","container-title":"Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI","DOI":"10.3390/ani11113226","ISSN":"2076-2615","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,11]]},"page":"3226","PMCID":"PMC8614296","PMID":"34827957","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Corvids in urban environments: a systematic global literature review","title-short":"Corvids in Urban Environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8614296/","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"berger-talSystematicReviewsMaps2019","abstract":"Although examples of successful applications of behavioral ecology research to policy and management exist, knowledge generated from such research is in many cases under-utilized by managers and policy makers. On their own, empirical studies and traditional reviews do not offer the robust syntheses that managers and policy makers require to make evidence-based decisions and evidence-informed policy. Similar to the evidence-based revolution in medicine, the application of formal systematic review processes has the potential to invigorate the field of behavioral ecology and accelerate the uptake of behavioral evidence in policy and management. Systematic reviews differ from traditional reviews and meta-analyses in that their methods are peer reviewed and prepublished for maximum transparency, the evidence base is widened to cover work published outside of academic journals, and review findings are formally communicated with stakeholders. This approach can be valuable even when the systematic literature search fails to yield sufficient evidence for a full review or meta-analysis; preparing systematic maps of the existing evidence can highlight deficiencies in the evidence base, thereby directing future research efforts. To standardize the use of systematic evidence syntheses in the field of environmental science, the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) created a workflow process to certify the comprehensiveness and repeatability of systematic reviews and maps, and to maximize their objectivity. We argue that the application of CEE guidelines to reviews of applied behavioral interventions will make robust behavioral evidence easily accessible to managers and policy makers to support their decision-making, as well as improve the quality of basic research in behavioral ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Berger-Tal","given":"Oded"},{"family":"Greggor","given":"Alison L"},{"family":"Macura","given":"Biljana"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Carrie Ann"},{"family":"Blumenthal","given":"Arden"},{"family":"Bouskila","given":"Amos"},{"family":"Candolin","given":"Ulrika"},{"family":"Doran","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Fernández-Juricic","given":"Esteban"},{"family":"Gotanda","given":"Kiyoko M"},{"family":"Price","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Putman","given":"Breanna J"},{"family":"Segoli","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Snijders","given":"Lysanne"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Bob B M"},{"family":"Blumstein","given":"Daniel T"}],"citation-key":"berger-talSystematicReviewsMaps2019","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","container-title-short":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/ary130","ISSN":"1045-2249","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,4]]},"page":"1-8","source":"Silverchair","title":"Systematic reviews and maps as tools for applying behavioral ecology to management and policy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/ary130","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"bergmullerIntegratingCooperativeBreeding2007","abstract":"In cooperative breeding systems, some individuals help to raise offspring that are not their own. While early explanations for such altruistic behaviour were predominantly based on kin selection, recent evidence suggests that direct benefits may be important in the maintenance of cooperation. To date, however, discussions of cooperative breeding have made little reference to more general theories of cooperation between unrelated individuals (while these theories rarely address cooperative breeding). Here, we attempt to integrate the two fields. We identify four key questions that can be used to categorise different mechanisms for the maintenance of cooperative behaviour: (1) whether or not individuals invest in others; (2) whether or not this initial investment elicits a return investment by the beneficiary; (3) whether the interaction is direct, i.e. between two partners, or indirect (involving third parties) and (4) whether only actions that increase the fitness of the partner or also fitness reducing actions (punishment) are involved in the interaction. Asking these questions with regards to concepts in the literature on cooperative breeding, we found that (a) it is often straightforward to relate these concepts to general mechanisms of cooperation, but that (b) a single term (such as ‘pay-to-stay’, ‘group augmentation’ or ‘prestige’) may sometimes subsume two or more distinct mechanisms, and that (c) at least some mechanisms that are thought to be important in cooperative breeding systems have remained largely unexplored in the theoretical literature on the evolution of cooperation. Future theoretical models should incorporate asymmetries in power and pay off structure caused for instance by dominance hierarchies or partner choice, and the use of N-player games. The key challenges for both theoreticians and empiricists will be to integrate the hitherto disparate fields and to disentangle the parallel effects of kin and non-kin based mechanisms of cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bergmüller","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Johnstone","given":"Rufus A."},{"family":"Russell","given":"Andrew F."},{"family":"Bshary","given":"Redouan"}],"citation-key":"bergmullerIntegratingCooperativeBreeding2007","collection-title":"Cooperative breeding","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","container-title-short":"Behavioural Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.beproc.2007.07.001","ISSN":"0376-6357","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"61-72","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Integrating cooperative breeding into theoretical concepts of cooperation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635707001866","volume":"76"},

  {"id":"bijmaMultilevelSelectionEstimating2007","abstract":"Interactions among individuals are universal, both in animals and in plants and in natural as well as domestic populations. Understanding the consequences of these interactions for the evolution of populations by either natural or artificial selection requires knowledge of the heritable components underlying them. Here we present statistical methodology to estimate the genetic parameters determining response to multilevel selection of traits affected by interactions among individuals in general populations. We apply these methods to obtain estimates of genetic parameters for survival days in a population of layer chickens with high mortality due to pecking behavior. We find that heritable variation is threefold greater than that obtained from classical analyses, meaning that two-thirds of the full heritable variation is hidden to classical analysis due to social interactions. As a consequence, predicted responses to multilevel selection applied to this population are threefold greater than classical predictions. This work, combined with the quantitative genetic theory for response to multilevel selection presented in an accompanying article in this issue, enables the design of selection programs to effectively reduce competitive interactions in livestock and plants and the prediction of the effects of social interactions on evolution in natural populations undergoing multilevel selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bijma","given":"Piter"},{"family":"Muir","given":"William M"},{"family":"Ellen","given":"Esther D"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Jason B"},{"family":"Van Arendonk","given":"Johan A M"}],"citation-key":"bijmaMultilevelSelectionEstimating2007","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.106.062729","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1,1]]},"page":"289-299","source":"Silverchair","title":"Multilevel Selection 2: Estimating the Genetic Parameters Determining Inheritance and Response to Selection","title-short":"Multilevel Selection 2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.106.062729","volume":"175"},

  {"id":"blitzStateDependentPresynapticInhibition2008","abstract":"Central pattern generators (CPGs) provide feedback to their projection neuron inputs. However, it is unknown whether this feedback is regulated and how that might shape CPG output. We are studying feedback from the pyloric CPG to identified projection neurons that regulate the gastric mill CPG, in the crab stomatogastric nervous system. Both CPGs are located in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and are influenced by projection neurons originating in the paired commissural ganglia (CoGs). Two extrinsic inputs [ventral cardiac neurons (VCNs) and postoesophageal commissure (POC) neurons] trigger distinct gastric mill rhythms despite acting via the same projection neurons [modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1); commissural projection neuron 2 (CPN2)]. These projection neurons receive feedback inhibition from the pyloric CPG interneuron anterior burster (AB), resulting in their exhibiting pyloric-timed activity during the retraction phase of the VCN- and POC-triggered gastric mill rhythms. However, during the gastric mill protraction phase, MCN1/CPN2 exhibit pyloric-timed activity during the POC-triggered rhythm but fire tonically during the VCN-triggered rhythm. Here, we show that the latter, tonic activity pattern results from the elimination of AB inhibition of MCN1/CPN2, despite persistent AB actions within the STG and AB action potentials still propagating into each CoG. This loss of pyloric-timed AB input likely results from presynaptic inhibition of AB in each CoG because, when a secondary rhythmic AB burst initiation zone in the CoG is activated, the associated action potentials are selectively suppressed during the VCN protraction phase. Thus, rhythmic CPG feedback can be locally regulated, in a state-dependent manner, enabling the same projection neurons to drive multiple motor patterns from the same neuronal circuit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Blitz","given":"Dawn M."},{"family":"Nusbaum","given":"Michael P."}],"citation-key":"blitzStateDependentPresynapticInhibition2008","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

By these standards, a vulture breaking an egg by hitting it with a stone uses a tool, but a gull dropping an egg on a rock does not. This distinction between true and borderline (or proto-tool) cases has been criticized for its arbitrariness and anthropocentrism. We show here that relative size of the neostriatum and whole brain distinguish the true and borderline categories in birds using tools to obtain food or water. From two sources, the specialized literature on tools and an innovation data base gathered in the short note sections of 68 journals in 7 areas of the world, we collected 39 true (e.g. use of probes, hammers, sponges, scoops) and 86 borderline (e.g. bait fishing, battering and dropping on anvils, holding with wedges and skewers) cases of tool use in 104 species from 15 parvorders. True tool users have a larger mean residual brain size (regressed against body weight) than do users of borderline tools, confirming the distinction in the literature. In multiple regressions, residual brain size and residual size of the neostriatum (one of the areas in the avian telencephalon thought to be equivalent to the mammalian neocortex) are the best predictors of true tool use reports per taxon. Innovation rate is the best predictor of borderline tool use distribution. Despite the strong concentration of true tool use cases in Corvida and Passerida, independent constrasts suggest that common ancestry is not responsible for the association between tool use and size of the neostriatum and whole brain. Our results demonstrate that birds are more frequent tool users than usually thought and that the complex cognitive processes involved in tool use may have repeatedly co-evolved with large brains in several orders of birds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Boire","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Nicolakakis","given":"Nektaria"},{"family":"Lefebvre","given":"Louis"}],"citation-key":"boireTOOLSBRAINSBIRDS2002","container-title":"Behaviour","DOI":"10.1163/156853902320387918","ISSN":"0005-7959, 1568-539X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"939-973","publisher":"Brill","source":"brill.com","title":"TOOLS AND BRAINS IN BIRDS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/139/7/article-p939_6.xml","volume":"139"},
  {"id":"bokonyChangingMigratoryBehaviors2019","abstract":"Change of avian migratory behavior is one of the best-studied phenomena presumably associated with contemporary climate change, yet to what degree these behavioral changes represent responses to climate warming is still controversial. We investigated interspecific variation in migratory behavior over three decades at a Central-European site, testing whether the type and extent of behavioral change are predicted by species' responsiveness to short-term variation in large-scale climatic indices. We found that species with earlier arrivals at the breeding grounds after winters with higher North-Atlantic Oscillation indices were more likely to overwinter at the study site. This behavior was more frequent in the second half than in the first half of the study, although the extent of this change was not predicted quantitatively by short-term climatic responsiveness. Overwintering was more prevalent in short-distance migrants with more complex diets and larger population sizes. Furthermore, species arriving earlier after summers with higher Sahel rainfall indices increasingly advanced their first arrival date, whereas species that do not molt in the pre-breeding season increased their frequency of overwintering in more recent years. Our results demonstrate that interspecific variation in short-term climatic responsiveness predicts long-term changes in migratory behaviors, supporting that the latter are responses to climate change. Furthermore, the type of response (advancing arrivals or overwintering near the breeding grounds) depends on life history. Finally, we found that overwintering behavior during the study period predicted subsequent trends in population size, suggesting that information on temporal changes in migratory strategy may help conservation planning and risk assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bókony","given":"Veronika"},{"family":"Barta","given":"Zoltán"},{"family":"Végvári","given":"Zsolt"}],"citation-key":"bokonyChangingMigratoryBehaviors2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.3389/fevo.2019.00089","ISSN":"2296-701X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"89","source":"Frontiers","title":"Changing Migratory Behaviors and Climatic Responsiveness in Birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2019.00089","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"bourkeValidityValueInclusive2011","abstract":"Social evolution is a central topic in evolutionary biology, with the evolution of eusociality (societies with altruistic, non-reproductive helpers) representing a long-standing evolutionary conundrum. Recent critiques have questioned the validity of the leading theory for explaining social evolution and eusociality, namely inclusive fitness (kin selection) theory. I review recent and past literature to argue that these critiques do not succeed. Inclusive fitness theory has added fundamental insights to natural selection theory. These are the realization that selection on a gene for social behaviour depends on its effects on co-bearers, the explanation of social behaviours as unalike as altruism and selfishness using the same underlying parameters, and the explanation of within-group conflict in terms of non-coinciding inclusive fitness optima. A proposed alternative theory for eusocial evolution assumes mistakenly that workers' interests are subordinate to the queen's, contains no new elements and fails to make novel predictions. The haplodiploidy hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested and positive relatedness within diploid eusocial societies supports inclusive fitness theory. The theory has made unique, falsifiable predictions that have been confirmed, and its evidence base is extensive and robust. Hence, inclusive fitness theory deserves to keep its position as the leading theory for social evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bourke","given":"Andrew F.

  {"id":"bsharyImageScoringCooperation2006","abstract":"Humans are highly social animals and often help unrelated individuals that may never reciprocate the altruist's favour. This apparent evolutionary puzzle may be explained by the altruist's gain in social image: image-scoring bystanders, also known as eavesdroppers, notice the altruistic act and therefore are more likely to help the altruist in the future. Such complex indirect reciprocity based on altruistic acts may evolve only after simple indirect reciprocity has been established, which requires two steps. First, image scoring evolves when bystanders gain personal benefits from information gathered, for example, by finding cooperative partners. Second, altruistic behaviour in the presence of such bystanders may evolve if altruists benefit from access to the bystanders. Here, we provide experimental evidence for both of the requirements in a cleaning mutualism involving the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. These cleaners may cooperate and remove ectoparasites from clients or they may cheat by feeding on client mucus. As mucus may be preferred over typical client ectoparasites, clients must make cleaners feed against their preference to obtain a cooperative service. We found that eavesdropping clients spent more tune next to 'cooperative' than 'unknown cooperative level' cleaners, which shows that clients engage in image-scoring behaviour. Furthermore, trained cleaners learned to feed more cooperatively when in an 'imagescoring' than in a 'non-image-scoring' situation.

  {"id":"buchanFitnessConsequencesDifferent2020","abstract":"Partial migration—wherein migratory and non-migratory individuals exist within the same population—represents a behavioural dimorphism; for it to persist over time, both strategies should yield equal individual fitness. This balance may be maintained through trade-offs where migrants gain survival benefits by avoiding unfavourable conditions, while residents gain breeding benefits from early access to resources. There has been little overarching quantitative analysis of the evidence for this fitness balance. As migrants—especially long-distance migrants—may be particularly vulnerable to environmental change, it is possible that recent anthropogenic impacts could drive shifts in fitness balances within these populations. We tested these predictions using a multi-taxa meta-analysis. Of 2,939 reviewed studies, 23 contained suitable information for meta-analysis, yielding 129 effect sizes. Of these, 73% (n = 94) reported higher resident fitness, 22% (n = 28) reported higher migrant fitness, and 5% (n = 7) reported equal fitness. Once weighted for precision, we found balanced fitness benefits across the entire dataset, but a consistently higher fitness of residents over migrants in birds and herpetofauna (the best-sampled groups). Residency benefits were generally associated with survival, not breeding success, and increased with the number of years of data over which effect sizes were calculated, suggesting deviations from fitness parity are not due to sampling artefacts. A pervasive survival benefit to residency documented in recent literature could indicate that increased exposure to threats associated with anthropogenic change faced by migrating individuals may be shifting the relative fitness balance between strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Buchan","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Gilroy","given":"James J."},{"family":"Catry","given":"Inês"},{"family":"Franco","given":"Aldina M.

  {"id":"bucherCentralPatternGenerators2015","abstract":"Essential behaviours such as walking or breathing are rhythmic, that is, characterised by repetitive activation of muscles in a specific temporal sequence. A basic version of the underlying neural activity is generated in the central nervous system by networks called central pattern generators (CPGs). CPGs can produce these patterns even in the absence of inputs that carry specific timing information. The core rhythmic activity can be based on intrinsic oscillatory properties of pacemaker neurons or emerge from the synaptic connectivity of nonoscillatory neurons. In both cases, other neurons are recruited into this rhythmic activity to generate a whole pattern. Neuronal and synaptic properties underlying the precise temporal patterning of sequential bursting activity are shaped by neuromodulators to generate different versions of motor patterns. The circuitry controlling rhythmic behaviours of a whole animal is organised in modules that control different body parts and can be coordinated in different ways to generate different behaviours. Key Concepts Essentially all rhythmic motor behaviours are based on CPGs. CPGs can produce patterned activity in the absence of patterned input. Rhythm generation can be based on intrinsically rhythmic neurons or network interactions. The speed, strength and specific temporal sequence in which CPG neurons fire arise from complex interactions of synaptic and intrinsic neuronal properties governed by diverse types of ion channels. CPG activity is modified by sensory feedback to adapt the motor pattern to changing environmental parameters. CPGs can be activated and reshaped by neuromodulators that adjust neuronal excitability by modifying or suppressing existing ionic currents or adding new currents and changing the properties of synapses. Neuromodulation provides flexibility of motor pattern generation to adjust output to changing behavioural demands. The central networks controlling rhythmic behaviours are inherently modular and allow different coordination of body parts for different behaviours or different versions of the same behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bucher","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Haspel","given":"Gal"},{"family":"Golowasch","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Nadim","given":"Farzan"}],"citation-key":"bucherCentralPatternGenerators2015","container-title":"eLS","DOI":"10.1002/9780470015902.a0000032.pub2","ISBN":"978-0-470-01590-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-12","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Central Pattern Generators","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470015902.a0000032.pub2"},

As a non-cooperative population, one of two habitat-use patterns was expected: (1) specialist habitat-use patterns in an abundant, widespread habitat type, with little variation among territories in habitat composition or (2) generalist habitat-use patterns with the potential of significant variation in habitat composition among territories. These jays show a combination of habitat-use patterns supporting both predictions. The only resources that males utilize as a specialist, tall oak trees during sentinel behavior, are fairly widespread and would not be considered a limiting resource. In the remaining habitat categories, Texas populations of Western Scrub-Jays act as generalists, using the habitat in relation to its availability, even though variation in habitat composition among territories is considerable. Variation among individuals within a sex was observed but could not be explained using various demographic and ecological correlates.

Specifically, we assigned species-specific scores based on continuous measures of response to urbanization, using VIIRS night-time light values (i.e. radiance) as a proxy for urbanization. We identified generalized, phylogenetically controlled patterns: bird species which are generalists (i.e. large niche breadth), with large clutch size, and large residual brain size are among the most urban-tolerant bird species. Conversely, specialized feeding strategies (i.e. insectivores and granivores) were negatively associated with urbanization.

  {"id":"carter2013","abstract":"Common vampire bats often regurgitate food to roost-mates that fail to feed. The original explanation for this costly helping behaviour invoked both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Several authors have since suggested that food sharing is maintained solely by indirect fitness because non-kin food sharing could have resulted from kin recognition errors, indiscriminate altruism within groups, or harassment. To test these alternatives, we examined predictors of food-sharing decisions under controlled conditions of mixed relatedness and equal familiarity. Over a 2 year period, we individually fasted 20 vampire bats (\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              ) and induced food sharing on 48 days. Surprisingly, donors initiated food sharing more often than recipients, which is inconsistent with harassment. Food received was the best predictor of food given across dyads, and 8.5 times more important than relatedness. Sixty-four per cent of sharing dyads were unrelated, approaching the 67 per cent expected if nepotism was absent. Consistent with social bonding, the food-sharing network was consistent and correlated with mutual allogrooming. Together with past work, these findings support the hypothesis that food sharing in vampire bats provides mutual direct fitness benefits, and is not explained solely by kin selection or harassment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Gerald G."},{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"Gerald S."}],"citation-key":"carter2013","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"carter2020","abstract":"Some nonhuman animals form adaptive long-term cooperative relationships with nonkin that seem analogous in form and function to human friendship [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, it remains unclear how these bonds initially form, especially when they entail investments of time and energy. Theory suggests individuals can reduce the risk of exploitation by initially spreading out smaller cooperative investments across time [e.g., 5] or partners [6], then gradually escalating investments in more cooperative partnerships [7]. Despite its intuitive appeal, this raising-the-stakes model [7] has gained surprisingly scarce empirical support. Although human strangers do “raise the stakes” when making bids in cooperation games [8], there has been no clear evidence for raising the stakes during formation of social bonds in nature. Existing studies are limited to cooperative interactions with severe power asymmetries (e.g., the cleaner-client fish mutualism [9]) or snapshots of a single behavior within established relationships (grooming in primates [10, 11, 12, 13]). Raising the stakes during relationship formation might involve escalating to more costly behaviors. For example, individuals could “test the waters” by first clustering for warmth (no cost), then conditionally grooming (low cost), and eventually providing coalitionary support (high cost). Detecting such a pattern requires introducing random strangers and measuring the emergence of natural helping behaviors that vary in costs. We performed this test by tracking the emergence of social grooming and regurgitated food donations among previously unfamiliar captive vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) over 15 months. We found compelling evidence that vampire bats selectively escalate low-cost grooming before developing higher-cost food-sharing relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Gerald G."},{"family":"Farine","given":"Damien R."},{"family":"Crisp","given":"Rachel J."},{"family":"Vrtilek","given":"Julia K."},{"family":"Ripperger","given":"Simon P."},{"family":"Page","given":"Rachel A."}],"citation-key":"carter2020","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2020.01.055","ISSN":"0960-9822","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"language":"en","page":"1275-1279.e3","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Development of New Food-Sharing Relationships in Vampire Bats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220300993","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"clemensVivoModulationInteracting1998","abstract":"The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the European lobsterHomarus gammarus contains two rhythm-generating networks (the gastric and pyloric circuits) that in resting, unfed animals produce two distinct, yet strongly interacting, motor patterns. By using simultaneous EMG recordings from the gastric and pyloric musclesin vivo, we found that after feeding, the gastropyloric interaction disappears as the two networks express accelerated motor rhythms. The return to control levels of network activity occurs progressively over the following 1–2 d and is associated with a gradual reappearance of the gastropyloric interaction. In parallel with this change in network activity is an alteration of oxygen levels in the blood. In resting, unfed animals, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) is most often between 1 and 2 kPa and then doubles within 1 hr after feeding, before returning to control values some 24 hr later. In vivo, experimental prevention of the arterial Po2 increase after feeding leads to a slowing of pyloric rhythmicity toward control values and a reappearance of the gastropyloric interaction, without apparent effect on gastric network operation. Using in vitropreparations of the stomatogastric nervous system and by changing oxygen levels uniquely at the level of the STG within the range observed in the intact animal, we were able to mimic most of the effects observed in vivo. Our data indicate that the gastropyloric interaction appears only during a “free run” mode of foregut activity and that the coordinated operation of multiple neural networks may be modulated by local changes in oxygenation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Clemens","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Massabuau","given":"Jean-Charles"},{"family":"Legeay","given":"Alexia"},{"family":"Meyrand","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Simmers","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"clemensVivoModulationInteracting1998","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

Non‐verbal communication by humans, both intentional and unintentional, can be interpreted by other species. We tested whether American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) were sensitive to human facial features under field conditions by comparing flight initiation distances and urgency of escape behavior to human approaches varying in eye contact and facial expression. We first examined whether crows distinguish between an approaching human who is directly gazing at them and a human approaching them with an averted gaze. In a second experiment, we tested whether crows differentiate a smiling from scowling human approaching them with direct or averted gaze. In the first experiment, we found that crows fled sooner and more urgently when humans were directly gazing at them. Similarly, in the second experiment, crows responded sooner to a direct vs. averted gaze; however, they did not react differently to varying human facial expressions. We suggest that crows use human gaze as a reliable visual cue compared with facial expressions when making decisions about responding to approaching humans. This is the first study to show that a wild corvid species changes its behavior based on human gaze, possibly representing an adaptation to living in human‐dominated urban areas and suggesting crows might perceive human intention by this visual cue.","author":[{"family":"Clucas","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."},{"family":"Mackovjak","given":"David"},{"family":"Palmquist","given":"Ila"}],"citation-key":"clucasAmericanCrowsPay2013","container-title":"Ethology","contributor":[{"family":"Ebensperger","given":"L."},{"family":"Ebensperger","given":"L."}],"DOI":"10.1111/eth.12064","ISSN":"0179-1613","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"eng","page":"296–302","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","source":"ocul-bu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","title":"Do American Crows Pay Attention to Human Gaze and Facial Expressions?","type":"article-journal","volume":"119"},
  {"id":"clutton-brock2002","abstract":"In cooperatively breeding vertebrates, nonbreeding helpers raise young produced by dominant breeders. Although the evolution of cooperative breeding has often been attributed primarily to kin selection (whereby individuals gain \"indirect\" benefits to their fitness by assisting collateral relatives), there is increasing evidence that helpers can be unrelated to the young they are raising. Recent studies also suggest that the indirect benefits of cooperative behavior may often have been overestimated while the direct benefits of helping to the helper's own fitness have probably been underestimated. It now seems likely that the evolutionary mechanisms maintaining cooperative breeding are diverse and that, in some species, the direct benefits of helping may be sufficient to maintain cooperative societies. The benefits of cooperation in vertebrate societies may consequently show parallels with those in human societies, where cooperation between unrelated individuals is frequent and social institutions are often maintained by generalized reciprocity.","author":[{"family":"Clutton-Brock","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"clutton-brock2002","container-title":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.296.5565.69","ISSN":"1095-9203","issue":"5565","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",4,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"69-72","PMID":"11935014","source":"PubMed","title":"Breeding together: kin selection and mutualism in cooperative vertebrates","title-short":"Breeding together","type":"article-journal","volume":"296"},

No information is available in this system, however, as to how the actions of this peptide are terminated. To study this issue in the crab Cancer borealis, we incubated exogenous proctolin (10(-5) M) with either the thoracic ganglion (TG) or with conditioned saline (CS) that had been preincubated with the TG. We removed aliquots at standard time points for analysis by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We found that over time the proctolin peak became progressively smaller, while three novel peaks appeared and increased in size. Comigration experiments using HPLC indicated that the major novel peak was Proct. (Tyr-Leu-Pro-Thr), while one of the two minor peaks was Proct. (Leu-Pro-Thr). The other minor peak appeared to be Proct. (Arg-Tyr), based on similar HPLC retention time to synthetic Proct. The reduction in the proctolin peak and the increase in the Proct. peak was prevented by co-incubation of proctolin with any one of several aminopeptidase inhibitors (10(-4) M). Proct. and Proct. appeared to result from a diaminopeptidase-mediated cleavage of proctolin. We tested whether N-terminal cleavage functionally inactivated proctolin by coapplying proctolin (10(-8) M) and individual aminopeptidase inhibitors (10(-5) M) to the isolated stomatogastric ganglion (STG). We found that these inhibitors significantly enhanced the proctolin excitation of the pyloric rhythm. Furthermore, application of synthetic Proct. to the STG had no effect unless high concentrations (> 10(-6) M) were used, and neither Proct. nor Proct. (10(-4) M) influenced the pyloric rhythm.

To bridge this gap, we studied feeding behavior-linked modulation of microcircuit activity in the isolated stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) of male Cancer borealis crabs. Specifically, we removed hemolymph from a crab that was unfed for ≥24 h (\"unfed\" hemolymph) or fed 15 min to 2 h before hemolymph removal (\"fed\" hemolymph). After feeding, the first significant foregut emptying occurred >1 h later and complete emptying required ≥6 h. We applied the unfed or fed hemolymph to the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) in an isolated STNS preparation from a separate, unfed crab to determine its influence on the VCN (ventral cardiac neuron)-triggered gastric mill (chewing) and pyloric (filtering of chewed food) rhythms. Unfed hemolymph had little influence on these rhythms, but fed hemolymph from each examined time-point (15 min, 1 h, or 2 h after feeding) slowed one or both rhythms without weakening circuit neuron activity. There were also distinct parameter changes associated with each time-point. One change unique to the 1-h time-point (i.e., reduced activity of one circuit neuron during the transition from the gastric mill retraction to protraction phase) suggested that the fed hemolymph also enhanced the influence of a projection neuron that innervates the STG from a ganglion isolated from the applied hemolymph.

The resulting intragenomic conflicts triggered by meiotic drive create evolutionary arms races and shape genome evolution. The phenomenon of meiotic drive is widespread across taxa but is particularly prominent in the Drosophila genus. Recent studies in Drosophila have provided insights into the genetic origins of drivers and their molecular mechanisms. Here, we review the current literature on mechanisms of drive with an emphasis on sperm killers in Drosophila species. In these systems, meiotic drivers often evolve from gene duplications and targets are generally linked to heterochromatin. While dense in repetitive elements and difficult to study using traditional genetic and genomic approaches, recent work in Drosophila has made progress on the heterochromatic compartment of the genome. Although we still understand little about precise drive mechanisms, studies of male drive systems are converging on common themes such as heterochromatin regulation, small RNA pathways, and nuclear transport pathways. Meiotic drive systems are therefore promising models for discovering fundamental features of gametogenesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Courret","given":"Cécile"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Ching-Ho"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Kevin H.-C."},{"family":"Montchamp-Moreau","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Larracuente","given":"Amanda M."}],"citation-key":"courretMeioticDriveMechanisms2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2019.1430","issue":"1913","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,23]]},"page":"20191430","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Meiotic drive mechanisms: lessons from Drosophila","title-short":"Meiotic drive mechanisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.1430","volume":"286"},

  {"id":"deleonUrbanizationErodesNiche2019","abstract":"Urbanization is influencing patterns of biological evolution in ways that are only beginning to be explored. One potential effect of urbanization is in modifying ecological resource distributions that underlie niche differences and that thus promote and maintain species diversification. Few studies have assessed such modifications, or their potential evolutionary consequences, in the context of ongoing adaptive radiation. We study this effect in Darwin's finches on the Galápagos Islands, by quantifying feeding preferences and diet niche partitioning across sites with different degrees of urbanization. We found higher finch density in urban sites and that feeding preferences and diets at urban sites skew heavily toward human food items. Furthermore, we show that finches at urban sites appear to be accustomed to the presence of people, compared with birds at sites with few people. In addition, we found that human behavior via the tendency to feed birds at non-urban but tourist sites is likely an important driver of finch preferences for human foods. Site differences in diet and feeding behavior have resulted in larger niche breadth within finch species and wider niche overlap between species at the urban sites. Both factors effectively minimize niche differences that would otherwise facilitate interspecies coexistence. These findings suggest that both human behavior and ongoing urbanization in Galápagos are starting to erode ecological differences that promote and maintain adaptive radiation in Darwin's finches. Smoothing of adaptive landscapes underlying diversification represents a potentially important yet underappreciated consequence of urbanization. Overall, our findings accentuate the fragility of the initial stages of adaptive radiation in Darwin's finches and raise concerns about the fate of the Galápagos ecosystems in the face of increasing urbanization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"De León","given":"Luis F."},{"family":"Sharpe","given":"Diana M.

For return-beneﬁts to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to another’s pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other’s welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Waal","given":"Frans B.M.","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"dewaal2008","container-title":"Annual Review of Psychology","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"dezoetenHowMigratoryPopulations2020","abstract":"Migratory behaviour is rapidly changing in response to recent environmental changes, yet it is difficult to predict how migration will evolve in the future. To understand what determines the rate of adaptive evolutionary change in migratory behaviour, we simulated the evolution of residency using an individual-based threshold model, which allows for variation in selection, number of genes, environmental effects and assortative mating. Our model indicates that the recent reduction in migratory activity found in a population of Eurasian blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) is only compatible with this trait being under strong directional selection, in which residents have the highest fitness and fitness declines exponentially with migration distance. All other factors had minor effects on the adaptive response. Under this form of selection, a completely migratory population will become partially migratory in 6 and completely resident in 98 generations, demonstrating the persistence of partial migration, even under strong directional selection. Resident populations will preserve large amounts of cryptic genetic variation, particularly if migration is controlled by a large number of genes with small effects. This model can be used to realistically simulate the evolution of any threshold trait, including semi-continuous traits like migration, for predicting evolutionary response to natural selection in the wild.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Zoeten","given":"Tiago","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Pulido","given":"Francisco"}],"citation-key":"dezoetenHowMigratoryPopulations2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2019.3011","issue":"1923","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,25]]},"page":"20193011","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"How migratory populations become resident","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.3011","volume":"287"},

The effects of neuromodulators interact with one another, and modulatory neurons are themselves often subject to modulation, enabling both higher order control and indirect interactions among central pattern generators. In addition, modulators often directly mediate the interactions between functionally related central pattern generators. In systems such as the vertebrate respiratory central pattern generator, multiple pacemaker types interact to produce rhythmic output. Modulators can then alter the relative contributions of the different pacemakers, leading to substantial changes in motor output and hence to different behaviors. Surprisingly, substantial changes in some aspects of the circuitry of a central pattern generator, such as a several-fold increase in synaptic strength, can sometimes have little effect on the output of the CPG, whereas other changes have profound effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Dickinson","given":"Patsy S"}],"citation-key":"dickinsonNeuromodulationCentralPattern2006","collection-title":"Motor systems / Neurobiology of behaviour","container-title":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.conb.2006.10.007","ISSN":"0959-4388","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"604-614","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Neuromodulation of central pattern generators in invertebrates and vertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438806001486","volume":"16"},

The cardiac sac network, which controls the rhythmic contractions of the cardiac sac in the foregut of crustaceans, is distributed throughout the stomatogastric nervous system, including the oesophageal ganglion (OG), the commissural ganglia (CGs), and the stomatogastric ganglion (STG). A red pigment-concentrating hormone (RPCH)-like peptide is likewise widely distributed. 2. The effects that bath application of the neuropeptide RPCH to the different ganglia has on the cardiac sac pattern were studied. 3. RPCH applied to the STG, the OG, or the CGs elicited bursting activity in all the known components of the cardiac sac pattern, including the two motor neurons, cardiac sac dilators 1 and 2 (CD1 and CD2), and the inferior ventricular nerve (ivn) fibers. 4. A cardiac sac pattern was also elicited when RPCH was applied to either the STG, the OG, or the CGs after synapses in that ganglion had been blocked by low Ca2+ saline containing 20 mM Co2+. 5. These data suggest that the ivn fibers are sensitive to RPCH and respond to it by generating bursting activity at or near their terminals in all four ganglia. 6. Application of RPCH to either the STG or the OG also caused an increase in the amplitude of the postsynaptic potential (PSP) from the ivn fibers to both CD1 and CD2. The increase was largest in the ganglion to which the RPCH was applied. 7. Repeated stimulation of the ivn, mimicking the bursts that occur during cardiac sac activity, also caused an increase in PSP amplitude, and so facilitation resulting from activation of ivn bursting could account for a portion of the increased amplitude seen in RPCH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","author":[{"family":"Dickinson","given":"P.

  {"id":"dinizUrbanCyclesHuman2021","abstract":"The weekend effect hypothesis predicts that weekly cycles of human activity impact animal behaviour and physiology. This hypothesis has been supported in the context of recreational activity in natural environments but it is unknown whether it also applies to urban animals. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the sentinel (territorial vigilance), foraging and vocal behaviours of an urban-dwelling bird, the Rufous Hornero Furnarius rufus, between weekdays and weekends (and holidays) within a university campus in central Brazil. The level of human activity (noise, trafﬁc and pedestrian ﬂow) increases greatly on weekdays on this campus. We predicted that the birds would perceive a greater predation risk and would need to adjust their acoustic signals in response to anthropogenic noise on weekdays. Thus, we expected that the birds would spend more time as sentinels and less time foraging, and would sing for longer periods and at a higher pitch on weekdays than on weekends. We also expected weaker duet responsiveness (answering partner-initiated song) on noisier weekdays than on weekends, assuming that noise would disrupt signal transmission between partners. We found that birds spent slightly more time (~ 4%) in sentinel behaviour and less time (~ 2–5%) foraging on weekdays than on weekends, but these effects were small and not statistically signiﬁcant. Birds were equally likely to sing solos, start duets and answer partner-initiated duets on weekends and weekdays. Finally, phrase duration and acoustic parameters of duets were similar on weekends and weekdays. Our results provide little support for the weekend effect hypothesis, suggesting that these urban-dwelling birds may be habituated or indifferent to periodic variation in human activity levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Diniz","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Silva‐Jr","given":"Edvaldo F."},{"family":"Macedo","given":"Regina H."}],"citation-key":"dinizUrbanCyclesHuman2021","container-title":"Ibis","container-title-short":"Ibis","DOI":"10.1111/ibi.12956","ISSN":"0019-1019, 1474-919X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1394-1408","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Urban cycles of human activity do not significantly alter the behaviour of a duetting bird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.12956","volume":"163"},

This might be because they have specific adaptations to urban conditions, because they are able to cope with artificial habitats in general or because they are generalists that can live in a wide range of conditions. We use the latest version of the IUCN database to distinguish these possibilities in 25,985 species of the four classes of terrestrial vertebrates with the help of phylogenetically controlled methods. We first compare species occurrence in cities with that of the five other artificial habitats recognized by the IUCN and use principal components analyses to ask which of these most resembles cities. We then test whether urban species have a wider habitat breadth than species occurring in other, non-urban, artificial habitats, as well as species that occur only in natural habitats. Our results suggest that the proportion of terrestrial vertebrates that occur in urban environments is small and that, among the species that do occur in cities, the great majority also occur in other artificial habitats. Our data also show that the presence of terrestrial vertebrates in urban habitats is skewed in favor of habitat generalists. In birds and mammals, species occurrence in urban areas is most similar to that of rural gardens, while in reptiles and amphibians, urban areas most resemble pasture and arable land.

However, most studies have simply considered if there is an effect of noise, examining the overall cohort response. Although substantial evidence exists for intraspecific variation in responses to other anthropogenic disturbances, this possibility has received relatively little experimental attention with respect to noise. Here, we used field-based playbacks with dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to test how traffic noise affects vigilance behavior and to examine potential variation between individuals of different age class, sex, and dominance status. Foragers exhibited a stronger immediate reaction and increased their subsequent vigilance (both that on the ground and as a sentinel) in response to traffic-noise playback compared with ambient-sound playback. Traffic-noise playback also resulted in sentinels conducting longer bouts and being more likely to change post height or location than in ambient-sound playback. Moreover, there was evidence of variation in noise responses with respect to age class and dominance status but not sex. In traffic noise, foraging pups were more likely to flee and were slower to resume foraging than adults; they also tended to increase their vigilance more than adults. Dominants were more likely than subordinates to move post during sentinel bouts conducted in traffic-noise trials. Our findings suggest that the vigilance–foraging trade-off is affected by traffic noise but that individuals differ in how they respond. Future work should, therefore, consider intrapopulation response variation to understand fully the population-wide effects of this global pollutant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Eastcott","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Kern","given":"Julie M"},{"family":"Morris-Drake","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Radford","given":"Andrew N"}],"citation-key":"eastcottIntrapopulationVariationBehavioral2020","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/araa011","editor":[{"family":"Candolin","given":"Ulrika"}],"ISSN":"1045-2249, 1465-7279","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,19]]},"language":"en","page":"680-691","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Intrapopulation variation in the behavioral responses of dwarf mongooses to anthropogenic noise","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/31/3/680/5748151","volume":"31"},

We completed assemblies of all wtf genes for two S. pombe isolates, as well as a subset of wtf genes from over 50 isolates. We find that wtf copy number can vary greatly between isolates and that amino acid substitutions, expansions and contractions of DNA sequence repeats, and nonallelic gene conversion between family members all contribute to dynamic wtf gene evolution.

  {"id":"eldakarRoleMultilevelSelection2010","abstract":"In evolution, exploitative strategies often create a paradox in which the most successful individual strategy “within” the group is also the most detrimental strategy “for” the group, potentially resulting in extinction. With regard to sexual conflict, the overexploitation of females by harmful males can yield similar consequences. Despite these evolutionary implications, little research has addressed why sexual conflict does not ultimately drive populations to extinction. One possibility is that groups experiencing less sexual conflict are more productive than groups with greater conflict. However, most studies of sexual conflict are conducted in a single isolated group, disregarding the potential for selection among groups. We observed Aquarius remigis water striders in a naturalistic multigroup pool in which individuals could freely disperse among groups. The free movement of individuals generated variation in aggression and sex-ratio among groups, thereby increasing the importance of between-group selection compared to within-group selection. Females dispersed away from local aggression, creating more favorable mating environments for less-aggressive males. Furthermore, the use of contextual analysis revealed that individual male aggression positively predicted fitness whereas aggression at the group level negatively predicted fitness, empirically demonstrating the conflict between levels of selection acting on mating aggression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Eldakar","given":"Omar Tonsi"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"David Sloan"},{"family":"Dlugos","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Pepper","given":"John W."}],"citation-key":"eldakarRoleMultilevelSelection2010","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01087.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"3183-3189","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Role of Multilevel Selection in the Evolution of Sexual Conflict in the Water Strider Aquarius Remigis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01087.x","volume":"64"},
  {"id":"ellers2010","abstract":"Altruistic behavior is known to be conditional on the level of altruism of others. However, people often have no information, or incomplete information, about the altruistic reputation of others, for example when the reputation was obtained in a different social or economic context. As a consequence, they have to estimate the other's altruistic intentions. Using an economic game, we showed that without reputational information people have intrinsic expectations about the altruistic behavior of others, which largely explained their own altruistic behavior. This implies that when no information is available, intrinsic expectations can be as powerful a driver of altruistic behavior as actual knowledge about other people's reputation. Two strategies appeared to co-exist in our study population: participants who expected others to be altruistic and acted even more altruistically themselves, while other participants had low expected altruism scores and acted even less altruistically than they expected others to do. We also found evidence that generosity in economic games translates into benefits for other social contexts: a reputation of financial generosity increased the attractiveness of partners in a social cooperative game. This result implies that in situations with incomplete information, the fitness effects of indirect reciprocity are cumulative across different social contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ellers","given":"Jacintha"},{"family":"Pool","given":"Nadia C.

In many species, unique classes of retinal ganglion cells selectively respond to visual stimuli that move in specific directions. It is not known which retinal cell first performs the neural computations that give rise to directional selectivity in the ganglion cell.

Using two-photon optical recordings of intracellular calcium concentration, here we find that individual dendritic branches of starburst cells act as independent computation modules. Dendritic calcium signals, but not somatic membrane voltage, are directionally selective for stimuli that move centrifugally from the cell soma.

  {"id":"fernandezcastro2022","abstract":"Small-scale turbulent mixing plays a pivotal role in shaping ocean circulation and a broad range of physical and biogeochemical processes. Despite advances in our understanding of the geophysical processes responsible for this mixing, the nature and importance of biomixing—turbulent mixing caused by marine biota—are still debated. A major source of uncertainty pertains to the efficiency of biomixing (the fraction of the turbulent energy produced through swimming that is spent in mixing the ocean vertically), which the few in situ observations available suggest to be much lower than that of geophysical turbulence. Here we shed light on this problem by analysing 14 days of continuous measurements of centimetre-scale turbulence in an area of coastal upwelling. We show that turbulent dissipation is elevated 10- to 100-fold (reaching 10−6–10−5 W kg−1) every night of the survey due to the swimming activity of large aggregations of anchovies that gather regularly over the spawning season. Turbulent mixing is invigorated concurrently with dissipation, and occurs with an efficiency comparable to that of geophysical turbulence. Our results demonstrate that biologically driven turbulence can be a highly effective mixing agent, and call for a re-examination of its impacts on productive upper ocean regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernández Castro","given":"Bieito"},{"family":"Peña","given":"Marian"},{"family":"Nogueira","given":"Enrique"},{"family":"Gilcoto","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Broullón","given":"Esperanza"},{"family":"Comesaña","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Bouffard","given":"Damien"},{"family":"Naveira Garabato","given":"Alberto C."},{"family":"Mouriño-Carballido","given":"Beatriz"}],"citation-key":"fernandezcastro2022","container-title":"Nature Geoscience","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"fleischerVariationForagingBehavior2003","abstract":"Supplemental food enables some birds to lay eggs earlier, perhaps by allowing birds to increase their energy intake or allocate energy from other activities to reproduction. We examined the relationships between prelaying behavior, food handling and consumption rates, and the timing of breeding of female Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in suburban and wildland habitats. Scrub-jays in suburban habitats had access to ad libitum human-provided foods; wildland jays did not. During both years of this study, suburban scrub-jays bred earlier than their wildland counterparts. Wildland scrub-jays bred earlier in 1997 than in 1996, but the timing of breeding by suburban scrub-jays did not vary between years. Suburban scrub-jays spent less time foraging and more time perching than wildland jays. They handled more food per hour and per foraging hour, suggesting their foraging was more efﬁcient. Despite this, food consumption rates did not differ between the two habitats. Neither time spent foraging or perching nor food consumption rates signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced variation in time of breeding among individuals. Time of breeding was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by site, year, and rate of food handling. Individuals that handled more food items per foraging hour, that is, those individuals that were most efﬁcient, were the earliest breeders in both habitats. These results suggest that foraging efﬁciency increases with access to human-provided food and that resource predictability may be a perceptual cue for the appropriate timing of breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Fleischer","given":"Arthur L."},{"family":"Bowman","given":"Reed"},{"family":"Woolfenden","given":"Glen E."}],"citation-key":"fleischerVariationForagingBehavior2003","container-title":"The Condor","DOI":"10.1093/condor/105.3.515","ISSN":"0010-5422, 1938-5129","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"515-527","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Variation in foraging behavior, diet, and time of breeding of Florida scrub-jays in suburban and wildland habitats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/condor/article/105/3/515/5563190","volume":"105"},

In the crayfish Astacus leptodactylus, we compared the in vitro relationship between the M(O2) of locomotor muscles as a function of the extracellular P(O2) and P(CO2) and in vivo circadian changes in blood gas tensions at various values of water P(O2). In vitro, the M(O2) of locomotor muscle, either at rest or when stimulated with CCCP, was O(2)-dependent up to an extracellular P(O2) of 8–10 kPa. In vivo, the existence of a night-time increase in arterial P(O2) of up to 4 kPa at water P(O2) values of 20 and 40 kPa was demonstrated, but an experimental increase in arterial P(O2) during the day did not lead to any rise in whole-body M(O2).

This paper clarifies the terms ‘synurbic’ and ‘synurbization’ and considers some of the problems of defining ‘urban’, before detailing some of the positive responses exhibited by urban species that may lead to synurbic populations. It may be particularly important to determine whether responses drive directional selection leading to adaptation and genetic differentiation, or are within the range of expected phenotypic plasticity, and observed responses are discussed within this context. Further investigation of species response to urban environments, including the frequency and significance of adaptation, will be important for understanding the emergence of synurbic populations and their implications for urban biodiversity and management.

  {"id":"friardBORISFreeVersatile2016","abstract":"Quantitative aspects of the study of animal and human behaviour are increasingly relevant to test hypotheses and find empirical support for them. At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open-source and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time-budget or single or grouped observations automatically and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioural features. The observation data and time-budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON). The observed events can be plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS and PDF).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Friard","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Gamba","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"friardBORISFreeVersatile2016","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12584","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"1325-1330","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"BORIS: a free, versatile open-source event-logging software for video/audio coding and live observations","title-short":"Boris","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12584","volume":"7"},

Thus, spatially offset lateral inhibition generates directionality at three different levels in the DS circuitry.

Less well understood are the rather more direct interactions between people and biodiversity in the urban arena. While there is a general concern that urbanization impoverishes human contact with nature, daily interaction with biodiversity in urban greenspaces and the widespread provision of food and nesting resources for wildlife form a part of many city-dwellers’ experience. Using data from the UK, we show that supplementary resource provision aimed explicitly at enhancing avian populations can result in high levels of additional foraging and nesting opportunities, particularly in urban areas. However, our data also indicate that levels of such resource provision are strongly positively correlated with human population density at a regional scale, and within a large city. The proportion of households participating in bird feeding depends on social and economic features of the human population, suggesting that strong covariation between human and ecological communities will result. Indeed, we demonstrate that the abundances of some urban-adapted bird species are positively related to the density of feeding stations across the urban landscape, although such relationships were not apparent for other species that commonly use garden feeding stations. It has been suggested that interactions with nature, such as feeding birds, could have beneficial consequences for human health. A better understanding of this potential feedback is required.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuller","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Irvine","given":"Katherine N."},{"family":"Davies","given":"Zoe G."},{"family":"Armsworth","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Gaston","given":"Kevin J."}],"citation-key":"fullerInteractionsPeopleBirds2012","DOI":"10.1525/california/9780520273092.003.0016","editor":[{"family":"Lepczyk","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Warren","given":"Paige S."}],"ISBN":"978-0-520-27309-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,26]]},"page":"249-266","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Interactions between People and Birds in Urban Landscapes","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/california-scholarship-online/book/28599/chapter/231567838"},

While ecological processes continue to operate within cities, urban ecosystems are profoundly different from their more natural counterparts. Thus, ecological predictions derived from more natural ecosystems are rarely generalizable to urban environments.\nIn this study, we used data from a large‐scale and long‐term camera trap project in Chicago IL, USA, to determine whether urbanization alters predator‐avoidance behaviour of urban prey species.\nWe studied three behavioural mechanisms often induced by the fear of predation (spatial distribution, daily activity patterns and vigilance) of white‐tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) when coyote (Canis latrans)—an urban apex predator—was present.\nWe found no evidence of spatial segregation between coyote and either prey species. Furthermore, neither white‐tailed deer nor eastern cottontail changed their daily activity or increased vigilance in urban areas when coyotes were present. Eastern cottontail, however, had their uppermost level of vigilance in highly urban sites when coyotes were absent.\nOur study demonstrates that predator–prey dynamics might be modified in urban ecosystems—moving from what is traditionally thought of as a two‐player system (predator and prey) to a three‐player system (predator, prey and people).\nThe authors found that urban prey species are less “afraid” of predators in cities, indicating that interactions between predators and prey in urban ecosystems may be better understood by considering three players instead of two: predators, prey and people.","author":[{"family":"Gallo","given":"Travis"},{"family":"Fidino","given":"Mason"},{"family":"Lehrer","given":"Elizabeth W."},{"family":"Magle","given":"Seth"},{"family":"Loison","given":"Anne"}],"citation-key":"galloUrbanizationAltersPredator2019","container-title":"The Journal of animal ecology","contributor":[{"family":"Loison","given":"Anne"}],"DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.12967","event-place":"England","ISSN":"0021-8790","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"eng","page":"793–803","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc","publisher-place":"England","source":"ocul-bu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","title":"Urbanization alters predator‐avoidance behaviours","type":"article-journal","volume":"88"},

To test this, we related map-based metrics of migratory diversity to recent population trends for 340 European breeding birds. Species that occupy larger non-breeding ranges relative to breeding, a characteristic we term ‘migratory dispersion’, were less likely to be declining than those with more restricted non-breeding ranges. Species with partial migration strategies (i.e. overlapping breeding and non-breeding ranges) were also less likely to be declining than full migrants or full residents, an effect that was independent of migration distance.

  {"id":"gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014","abstract":"Biodiversity loss—one of the most prominent forms of modern environmental change—has been heavily driven by terrestrial habitat loss and, in particular, the spread and intensification of agriculture. Expanding agricultural land-use has led to the search for strong conservation strategies, with some suggesting that biodiversity conservation in agriculture is best maximized by reducing local management intensity, such as fertilizer and pesticide application. Others highlight the importance of landscape-level approaches that incorporate natural or semi-natural areas in landscapes surrounding farms. Here, we show that both of these practices are valuable to the conservation of biodiversity, and that either local or landscape factors can be most crucial to conservation planning depending on which types of organisms one wishes to save. We performed a quantitative review of 266 observations taken from 31 studies that compared the impacts of localized (within farm) management strategies and landscape complexity (around farms) on the richness and abundance of plant, invertebrate and vertebrate species in agro-ecosystems. While both factors significantly impacted species richness, the richness of sessile plants increased with less-intensive local management, but did not significantly respond to landscape complexity. By contrast, the richness of mobile vertebrates increased with landscape complexity, but did not significantly increase with less-intensive local management. Invertebrate richness and abundance responded to both factors. Our analyses point to clear differences in how various groups of organisms respond to differing scales of management, and suggest that preservation of multiple taxonomic groups will require multiple scales of conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Gonthier","given":"David J."},{"family":"Ennis","given":"Katherine K."},{"family":"Farinas","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Hsieh","given":"Hsun-Yi"},{"family":"Iverson","given":"Aaron L."},{"family":"Batáry","given":"Péter"},{"family":"Rudolphi","given":"Jörgen"},{"family":"Tscharntke","given":"Teja"},{"family":"Cardinale","given":"Bradley J."},{"family":"Perfecto","given":"Ivette"}],"citation-key":"gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"goodalePredatorEavesdroppingMixedSpecies2019","abstract":"The field of predator eavesdropping concentrates on the detection by a predator or parasite of signals that prey direct at conspecifics, and the subsequent evolution by prey to avoid or lessen such detection. Here, we first point out that signaling prey species are often found in mixed-species moving groups or stationary aggregations, and ask the question of how simultaneous signaling, by members of one species or more, might affect predator eavesdropping behavior and the composition of the groups themselves. The detection risk of prey species will be affected by the other species they associate with, and prey should generally avoid joining a group with more detectable species. Yet prey may select to join other species that are preferred by predators, diluting their own risk of attack, as long as that does not lead to substantially greater detection and thereby increased predation. We next review the evidence that prey grouping and collective responses when attacked can confuse predators, leading to lower capture rates. Evidence for this confusion effect mostly involves visually orienting predators. We then ask if a similar phenomenon could occur when animals in a group simultaneously produce acoustic signals and find relevant evidence for predator confusion under such situations in the literature associated with the “cocktail party effect.” As confusion is heightened by similarities among mixed-species group members, this provides a force at ecological or evolutionary timescales to make species that associate in groups, and their signals, more similar to each other. However, heterogeneous mixed-species groups may be favored if species are differentially preferred as prey. We suggest experiments to examine whether the success rates of acoustically orienting predators depend on the group size of their mixed-species prey. More observations on the relative positions of conspecifics and heterospecifics in space, and the temporal association of their signals, will also increase our understanding of the relationship between mixed-species grouping and predator eavesdropping.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Goodale","given":"Eben"},{"family":"Ruxton","given":"Graeme D."},{"family":"Beauchamp","given":"Guy"}],"citation-key":"goodalePredatorEavesdroppingMixedSpecies2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.3389/fevo.2019.00141","ISSN":"2296-701X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"141","source":"Frontiers","title":"Predator Eavesdropping in a Mixed-Species Environment: How Prey Species May Use Grouping, Confusion, and the Cocktail Party Effect to Reduce Predator Detection","title-short":"Predator Eavesdropping in a Mixed-Species Environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2019.00141","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"goodnightMultilevelSelectionKin2013","abstract":"When Hamilton defined the concept of inclusive fitness, he specifically was looking to define the fitness of an individual in terms of that individual's behavior, and the effects of its’ behavior on other related individuals. Although an intuitively attractive concept, issues of accounting for fitness, and correctly assigning it to the appropriate individual make this approach difficult to implement. The direct fitness approach has been suggested as a means of modeling kin selection while avoiding these issues. Whereas Hamilton's inclusive fitness approach assigns to the focal individual the fitness effects of its behavior on other related individuals, the direct fitness approach assigns the fitness effects of other actors to the focal individual. Contextual analysis was independently developed as a quantitative genetic approach for measuring multilevel selection in natural populations. Although the direct fitness approach and contextual analysis come from very different traditions, both methods rely on the same underlying equation, with the primary difference between the two approaches being that the direct fitness approach uses fitness optimization modeling, whereas with contextual analysis, the same equation is used to solve for the change in fitness associated with a change in phenotype when the population is away from the optimal phenotype.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Goodnight","given":"Charles"}],"citation-key":"goodnightMultilevelSelectionKin2013","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01821.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"1539-1548","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"On Multilevel Selection and Kin Selection: Contextual Analysis Meets Direct Fitness","title-short":"On Multilevel Selection and Kin Selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01821.x","volume":"67"},
  {"id":"gorenzelEvaluationLasersDisperse2002","abstract":"American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) have a long history of causing agricultural damage in North America. Shooting and bombing at crow night roosts have been employed to reduce such damage. Most roosts were located in rural locations, but in the latter half of the 1900s crows began to roost in urban locations. Urban crow roosts are presently a nationwide problem in the United States. Thousands of crows at a roost create problems for businesses and residents. Improved control techniques are needed. Lasers have been used in Europe to scare and disperse birds but the technique has only recently received formal testing. We treated urban roosts with lasers to determine if crows react to laser light, can be dispersed from roosts, and whether lasers are effective for eliciting roost abandonment. We treated 63 roosts in Woodland, California and recorded the immediate and short-term reactions of crows. We counted crows at five roosts in Davis, California during an 8-day pre-treatment period and then again during a 4-day treatment period to evaluate crow response to laser treatment. Crows reacted to the laser beam. In Woodland 100% of the crows flew immediately away from 49% of the treated roosts. Between 50% to 99% of all crows flew immediately away at 44% of the treated roosts. At 84% of the roosts crows left without vocalizing and at 95% of the roosts flew directly away without circling overhead. Crows returned to all roosts within 15 min. In Davis there was no difference in the number of crows using roosts during the pre-treatment versus treatment periods. Despite initial dispersal upon treatment, crows reoccupied all treated roosts the same night after treatment. No roosts were abandoned. Therefore, we do not recommend lasers as a stand-alone dispersal tool at urban crow roosts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Gorenzel","given":"W.

  {"id":"gotandaHumanInfluencesAntipredator2020","abstract":"Humans exert dramatic influences upon the environment, creating novel selective pressures to which organisms must adapt. On the Galapagos, humans have established a permanent presence and have altered selective pressures through influences such as invasive predators and urbanization, affecting iconic species such as Darwin's finches. Here, I ask two key questions: (a) Does antipredator behaviour (e.g., flight initiation distance – FID) change depending on whether invasive predators are historically absent, present, or eradicated? and (b) To what degree does urbanization affect antipredator behaviour? This study is one of the first to quantify antipredator behaviour in endemic species after the eradication of invasive predators. This will help to understand the consequences of invasive predator eradication and inform conservation measures. I quantified FID, an antipredator behaviour, in the small ground finch, across multiple islands in the Galapagos that varied in the presence, absence, or successful eradication of invasive predators. On islands with human populations, I quantified FID in urban and non-urban populations of finches. FID was higher on islands with invasive predators compared to islands with no predators. On islands from which invasive predators were eradicated 11 years previously, FID was also higher than on islands with no invasive predators. Within islands that had both urban and non-urban populations of finches, FID was lower in urban finch populations, but only above a threshold human population size. FID in larger urban areas on islands with invasive predators was similar to or lower than FID on islands with no history of invasive predators. Overall, these results suggest that invasive predators can have a lasting effect on antipredator behaviour, even after eradication. Furthermore, the effect of urbanization can strongly oppose the effect of invasive predators, reducing antipredator behaviour to levels lower than found on pristine islands with no human influences. These results improve our understanding of human influences on antipredator behaviour which can help inform future conservation and management efforts on islands.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gotanda","given":"Kiyoko M."}],"citation-key":"gotandaHumanInfluencesAntipredator2020","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.13127","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 The Author.

However, it is unclear whether the fear of novel objects, object neophobia, consistently varies in response to human disturbance. Where variation has been documented, it is unclear whether this variation is due to a change in fear towards specific novel stimuli, or whether it is symptomatic of a general change in fear behaviour. We measured levels of object neophobia in free-flying birds across urban and rural habitats, comparing corvids, a family known for being behaviourally flexible and innovative, with other urban-adapting bird species. Neophobic responses were measured in the presence of different types of objects that varied in their novelty, and were compared to behaviour during a baited control. Corvids were more neophobic than noncorvid species towards all object types, but their hesitancy abated after conspecifics approached in experimental conditions in which objects resembled items they may have experienced previously. Both sets of species were faster to approach objects made from human litter in urban than rural areas, potentially reflecting a category-specific reduction in fear based on experience. These results highlight species similarities in behavioural responses to human-dominated environments despite large differences in baseline neophobia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Greggor","given":"Alison L."},{"family":"Clayton","given":"Nicola S."},{"family":"Fulford","given":"Antony J.

  {"id":"gristReproductivePerformanceResident2017","abstract":"Quantifying among-individual variation in life-history strategies, and associated variation in reproductive performance and resulting demographic structure, is key to understanding and predicting population dynamics and life-history evolution. Partial migration, where populations comprise a mixture of resident and seasonally migrant individuals, constitutes a dimension of life-history variation that could be associated with substantial variation in reproductive performance. However, such variation has rarely been quantified due to the challenge of measuring reproduction and migration across a sufficient number of seasonally mobile males and females. We used intensive winter (non-breeding season) resightings of colour-ringed adult European shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) from a known breeding colony to identify resident and migrant individuals. We tested whether two aspects of annual reproductive performance, brood hatch date and breeding success, differed between resident and migrant males, females and breeding pairs observed across three consecutive winters and breeding seasons. The sex ratios of observed resident and migrant shags did not significantly differ from each other or from 1:1, suggesting that both sexes are partially migratory and that migration was not sex-biased across surveyed areas. Individual resident males and females hatched their broods 6 days earlier and fledged 0.2 more chicks per year than migrant males and females on average. Resident individuals of both sexes therefore had higher breeding success than migrants. Hatch date and breeding success also varied with a pair's joint migratory strategy such that resident–resident pairs hatched their broods 12 days earlier than migrant–migrant pairs, and fledged 0.7 more chicks per year on average. However, there was no evidence of assortative pairing with respect to migratory strategy: observed frequencies of migrant–migrant and resident–resident pairs did not differ from those expected given random pairing. These data demonstrate substantial variation in two key aspects of reproductive performance associated with the migratory strategies of males, females and breeding pairs within a partially migratory population. These patterns could reflect direct and/or indirect mechanisms, but imply that individual variation in migratory strategy and variation in pairing among residents and migrants could influence selection on migration and drive complex population and evolutionary dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Grist","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Daunt","given":"Francis"},{"family":"Wanless","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Burthe","given":"Sarah J."},{"family":"Newell","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Mike P."},{"family":"Reid","given":"Jane M."}],"citation-key":"gristReproductivePerformanceResident2017","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.12691","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"1010-1021","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Reproductive performance of resident and migrant males, females and pairs in a partially migratory bird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.12691","volume":"86"},

To study the interaction between neuromodulators and temperature perturbations, we studied the effects of temperature on preparations from which the descending modulatory inputs were removed. Under these conditions, the pyloric rhythm was destabilized. We then studied the effects of temperature on preparations in the presence of oxotremorine, proctolin, and serotonin. Oxotremorine and proctolin enhanced the robustness of the pyloric rhythm, whereas serotonin made the rhythm less robust.

With the rise of evidence-base medicine and increasing numbers of published systematic reviews, criteria for assessing the quality of reporting have been developed. First QUOROM (Lancet 354:1896–1900, 1999) and then PRISMA (Ann Intern Med 151:264, 2009) were developed as reporting guidelines and standards to ensure medical meta-analyses and systematic reviews are reported to a high level of detail. PRISMA is now widely used by a range of journals as a pre-submission checklist. However, due to its development for systematic reviews in healthcare, PRISMA has limited applicability for reviews in conservation and environmental management. We highlight 12 key problems with the application of PRISMA to this field, including an overemphasis on meta-analysis and no consideration for other synthesis methods. We introduce ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses), a pro forma and flow diagram designed specifically for systematic reviews and systematic maps in the field of conservation and environmental management. We describe how ROSES solves the problems with PRISMA. We outline the key benefits of our approach to designing ROSES, in particular the level of detail and inclusion of rich guidance statements. We also introduce the extraction of meta-data that describe key aspects of the conduct of the review. Collated together, this summary record can help to facilitate rapid review and appraisal of the conduct of a systematic review or map, potentially speeding up the peer-review process.

This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices.

Using vertebrate locomotion, respiration and mastication as exemplars, I describe four main principles of rhythmogenesis: (1) rhythmogenic ionic currents underlie all CPG networks, regardless of whether they are driven by a network pacemaker or an endogenous pacemaker neuron kernel; (2) fast synaptic transmission often evokes slow currents that can affect cycle frequency; (3) there are likely to be multiple and redundant mechanisms for rhythmogenesis in any essential CPG network; and (4) glial cells may participate in CPG network function., The neural basis for rhythmogenesis in simple behaviors has been studied for almost 100 years, yet we cannot identify with certainty the detailed mechanisms by which rhythmic behaviors are generated in any vertebrate system. Early studies focused on whether locomotor rhythms were generated by a chain of coupled reflexes that require sensory feedback, or by a central neural network. By now there is general agreement that for the major rhythmic behaviors (including locomotion, respiration, and mastication, the subjects of this book), there exist CPG networks within the central nervous system that are able to drive the basic rhythmic behavior in the complete absence of sensory feedback. This of course does not eliminate an important role for sensory feedback, which certainly affects cycle frequency and for some behaviors determines the timing of one phase of the behavior. Given the existence of CPGs, the question of rhythmogenesis can be rephrased to ask how these networks determine the timing of the rhythmic behavior. In this chapter, I focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms that could underlie rhythmogenesis in CPG networks, especially those that drive locomotion, respiration, and mastication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris-Warrick","given":"Ronald M."}],"citation-key":"harris-warrickGeneralPrinciplesRhythmogenesis2010","container-title":"Progress in brain research","container-title-short":"Prog Brain Res","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-444-53613-6.00014-9","ISSN":"0079-6123","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"213-222","PMCID":"PMC3005202","PMID":"21111210","source":"PubMed Central","title":"General Principles of Rhythmogenesis in Central Pattern Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005202/","volume":"187"},

Studies have attempted to make generalizations about how species with similar traits respond to urbanization, although existing results are idiosyncratic across cities and often fail to account for seasonality. Here, we present a comparative study in three US cities: Fresno, California; Tucson, Arizona; and Phoenix, Arizona. Using presence-absence data to define regional bird species pools and urban assemblages in non-breeding (winter) and breeding (spring) seasons, we tested whether urban avian assemblages were a random subset of regional assemblages on the basis of both traits and phylogeny, and whether urbanization was associated with homogenization among avian assemblages. We found evidence for non-random trait filtering into urban assemblages, including of diet guilds, migratory status, and primary habitat, but filtering differed across cities and seasons, being strongest for diet and in Fresno. There was no evidence for non-random phylogenetic-based filtering in urban avian assemblages. Dissimilarity in species and diet guild composition within each season was higher between cities than between regional species pools. These findings show the potential for biotic differentiation as opposed to homogenization as the outcome of environmental filtering processes operating on species traits across cities and seasons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hensley","given":"Christopher B."},{"family":"Trisos","given":"Christopher H."},{"family":"Warren","given":"Paige S."},{"family":"MacFarland","given":"Jennie"},{"family":"Blumenshine","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Reece","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Katti","given":"Madhusudan"}],"citation-key":"hensleyEffectsUrbanizationNative2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.3389/fevo.2019.00071","ISSN":"2296-701X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"71","source":"Frontiers","title":"Effects of Urbanization on Native Bird Species in Three Southwestern US Cities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2019.00071","volume":"7"},

Forest birds were color-banded monthly staning December 1999. Sixty-three observations of flocks were made containing a toral of 10 species with a mean (± SD) of2.8 ± 0.9 species and 5.4 ± 1.8 individuals per flock. The entire Poly/rpis bird community contained 30 core species. Since the forest was small, most flocks contained at least some of the same individuals. Three species occurred in > 70% (Giant Conebill Orromanrs ftasrri, Tawny Tit-Spinetail Lrptastlm/llm yanaemsis, and White-throated Tyrannulet !llreoerrmlus lmcophrys, with 2.6 ± 0.6, 1.9 ± 0.6, and 1.6 ± 0.5 individuals per flock respectively), one species (Astlmzrs dorbignyi with 1.4 ± 0.5 individuals per flock) in 21 %, and the remaining six species in £ 5% of all flocks. All flock panicipants except one were insectivores. Individuals of o.ftasrri showed high intraspecific group or pair fidelity and often, but not always, acted as flock leader, whereas the sentinel role was mainly assumed by 1. yanacmsis or A. dorbignyi. For rhe three species regularly associared wirh mixed-species flocks, home ranges of banded individuals observed in flocks were determined. Mean home ranges (100% minimum convex polygons) were 6.13 ± 0.87 ha for o.ftasrri (n = 4), 2.13 ± 1.26 ha for 1. yanaemsis (n = 6), and 3.41 ± 2.73 ha for M. lmeophrys (n = 3). Intraspecific home range overlap was moderate to high in all species, clear associations of Tawny Tir-Spinetail and White-throared Tyrannulet individuals with one of rhe two Giant Conebill pairs/groups were lacking, and agonisric interacrions were almost absent excepr in August. In orher words, neither individuals nor flocks were territorial, and flocks were much more loosely structured than those studied in Neotropicallowlands, resembling in some respects mixed-species flocks in northern temperate zones.

  {"id":"hillemannWaitingBetterNot2014","abstract":"Self-control, that is, overcoming impulsivity towards immediate gratification in favour of a greater but delayed reward, is seen as a valuable skill when making future-oriented decisions. Experimental studies in nonhuman primates revealed that individuals of some species are willing to tolerate delays of up to several minutes in order to gain food of a higher quantity or quality. Recently, birds (carrion crows, Corvus corone, common ravens, Corvus corax, Goffin cockatoos, Cacatua goffiniana) performed comparably to primates in an exchange task, contradicting previous notions that birds may lack any impulse control. However, performance differed strikingly with the currency of exchange: individuals of all three species performed better when asked to wait for a higher food quality, rather than quantity. Here, we built on this work and tested whether the apparent difference in levels of self-control expressed in quality versus quantity tasks reflects cognitive constraints or is merely due to methodological limitations. In addition to the exchange paradigm, we applied another established delay maintenance methodology: the accumulation task. In this latter task, food items accumulated to a maximum of four pieces, whereas in the exchange task, an initial item could be exchanged for a reward item after a certain time delay elapsed. In both tasks, birds (seven crows, five ravens) were asked to wait in order to optimize either the quality or the quantity of food. We found that corvids were willing to delay gratification when it led to a food reward of higher quality, but not when waiting was rewarded with a higher quantity, independent of the experimental paradigm. This study is the first to test crows and ravens with two different paradigms, the accumulation and the exchange of food, within the same experiment, allowing for fair comparisons between methods and species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hillemann","given":"Friederike"},{"family":"Bugnyar","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kotrschal","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Wascher","given":"Claudia A.

The Smooth-billed Ani, Crotophaga ani, a joint-nesting cooperatively breeding bird, appears to have a sentinel system; however, it is unknown whether that vigilance is coordinated, the defining feature of sentinel behaviour. We followed social groups during two breeding seasons to observe and time their individual sentinel bouts. We then tested for coordination by quantifying the observed and expected proportions of time during which (1) no sentinel was present during observations, and (2) two or more sentinels were present. The majority of social groups spent less time than expected, under the coordination hypothesis, with at least one sentinel, indicating evidence against coordinated vigilance. This was significant for social groups observed in 2015, but not in 2002. Across both years, temporal overlap in sentinel behaviour between two individuals occurred significantly less than expected under the coordination hypothesis. This study contributes to a gap in our knowledge of sentinel behaviour and suggests that Smooth-billed Anis lack organized vigilance, possibly due to low within-group relatedness and group instability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hing","given":"Jing Sheng"},{"family":"Schmaltz","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Quinn","given":"James S."}],"citation-key":"hingTestingSentinelCoordination2019","container-title":"Journal of Ornithology","container-title-short":"J Ornithol","DOI":"10.1007/s10336-018-1584-6","ISSN":"2193-7192, 2193-7206","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","page":"165-172","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Testing for sentinel coordination in Smooth-billed Anis (<i>Crotophaga ani</i>)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10336-018-1584-6","volume":"160"},

  {"id":"horrocksSentinelBehaviourVervet1986","abstract":"Crop-raiding by wildlife species often involves collective group movement and animal decision-making in this context is an important area of investigation as the risks and rewards associated with crop-raiding are greater than those that are likely to occur in wild food foraging situations. Yet, the form of consensus decision-making involved in wildlife crop-raiding has not been evaluated. In the current study, we assessed the decision-making process exhibited by rhesus macaques, a generalist primate species, in the context of crop-raiding. We predicted that rhesus macaques would display unshared consensus decision-making during the higher risk-entailed crop-raiding collective movements. We followed two groups of rhesus macaques and collected data on their movement and foraging behavior during crop-raiding events. The results from our study showed that collective movements in the context of crop-raiding were largely led by single individuals. However, individuals of all age-sex categories successfully led crop-raiding collective movements. Although adult individuals joined adult-initiated raid movements most often, they also joined raids initiated by other age classes. Contrary to our predictions, in crop-raiding contexts, rhesus macaques demonstrated a tendency towards equally shared decision-making for group movements.\nIn many cooperatively breeding species, one of the group members (called a sentinel) flies or climbs up occasionally to a high position, looks around and utters alarm calls if a predator approaches, while other group members are foraging. Bednekoff's (1997, American Naturalist, 150, 373–392; 2001, Annales Zoologici Fennici, 38, 5–14) game-theoretic model assumes that group members trade the need to forage against the advantages of earlier risk detection when sentinelling. The model predicts that in the presence of another sentinel which may provide timely alerts, a sentinel will terminate its sentinel bout earlier when its energy level drops below a threshold that is higher than the depletion threshold that would incentivize it to resume foraging if it were sentinelling alone. We propose a complementary hypothesis, that this effect of shortened sentinel duration in the presence of another sentinel will be more pronounced for subordinate group members, for whom the fierce competition they suffer while foraging gets attenuated when a groupmate sentinels. We tested these hypotheses in Arabian babbler, Argya squamiceps, groups by comparing sentinel activity under natural conditions vis-à-vis sentinel activity in a feeding experiment in which one or two individuals were fed. In natural conditions, dominant males not only acted as sentinels longer and more often, but they also initiated a larger share of their sentinel bouts when another group member was already on guard. Following experimental feeding ad libitum, in line with the game-theoretic predictions (1) the probability of starting a sentinel bout was not affected by the presence of another sentinel, nor by its sex or rank, and (2) sentinel bouts that terminated in the presence of another sentinel were significantly shorter than sentinel bouts ending alone. Our findings suggest that the seemingly systematic exchange of sentinels may be a consequence of differential needs and incentives rather than active coordination.\nIncreased vulnerability to predation results in young individuals of many species experiencing higher predation pressure than adults. Consequently, the production of antipredator-related calls by young can differ from that of the same vocalizations given by adults. Sentinel behaviour is a coordinated vigilance behaviour, where one individual climbs on an elevated position and scans the surroundings for predators, while the rest of the group is mainly foraging. Meerkat, Suricata suricatta, sentinels produce six distinct sentinel call types, which inform other group members about the perceived predation risk, resulting in the adjustment of personal vigilance behaviour in foraging group members. Here, we investigated the onset of sentinel behaviour and the ontogeny of the different sentinel call types as well as the development of individual vocal signatures in meerkats. We found that meerkats started acting as a sentinel around 200 days of age, but this was highly dependent on group size, with individuals from smaller groups exhibiting sentinel behaviour earlier than individuals from larger groups. All six sentinel call types were already present in the repertoire upon first emergence of the behaviour; however, call rates of ‘all-clear’ calls increased while ‘warning’ calls decreased with increasing experience as sentinel. Analysis of one of the most frequent sentinel calls, the double note calls, indicated that fundamental frequency, mean amplitude, duration and entropy differed consistently between individuals, but we found no effect of age. Rather, our results provide evidence that individual signatures in this call type were already developed when young meerkats first started to act as sentinel and changed little with age. To conclude, we showed little ontogenetic change in overall sentinel behaviour as well as in its vocal coordination, indicating potentially high selection pressures on antipredator behaviours, such as the sentinel system, resulting in consistent behavioural responses upon first emergence.\nTo maximize survival, animals should adjust their behaviour flexibly in response to indicators of predation risk. Predation risk is affected by a range of ecological, social and individual variables, which can fluctuate over different timescales. In general, current risk levels are known to influence the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates are engaged in other activities. However, there has been little consideration of whether decisions made at different stages of a sentinel bout are affected in the same way by perceived predation risk and whether the same level of behavioural plasticity is exhibited when making these different decisions. Here we used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment to investigate the behavioural choices of dwarf mongoose sentinels at three different stages of a bout (before, start, during). Individuals were more likely to begin a bout, and did so sooner, following alarm calls, which are immediate, direct indicators of elevated risk. Sentinels selected an initial height from which to guard depending on factors that tended to vary in the medium term (hours), choosing higher positions in denser habitat and less windy conditions. In contrast, decisions about bout duration were made in relation to short-term (seconds/minutes) changes in information, with sentinels guarding for longer when an alarm call was given during a bout, and terminating bouts sooner when groupmates moved out of sight. Our results demonstrate that sentinel decisions are influenced by both direct and indirect indicators of likely predation risk and that sentinel behaviour is adjusted flexibly with regard to information presented on various timescales, highlighting the complexity of decision-making processes.\nMany foraging animals face a fundamental tradeoff between predation and starvation 1, 2. In a range of social species, this tradeoff has probably driven the evolution of sentinel behavior, where individuals adopt prominent positions to watch for predators while groupmates forage [3]. Although there has been much debate about whether acting as a sentinel is a selfish or cooperative behavior 3, 4, 5, 6, far less attention has focused on why sentinels often produce quiet vocalizations (hereafter known as “sentinel calls”) to announce their presence 7, 8. We use observational and experimental data to provide the first evidence that group members gain an increase in foraging success by responding to these vocal cues given by sentinels. Foraging pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) spread out more, use more exposed patches, look up less often, and spend less time vigilant in response to sentinel calling. Crucially, we demonstrate that these behavioral alterations lead to an increase in biomass intake by foragers, which is likely to enhance survival. We argue that this benefit may be the reason for sentinel calling, making it a truly cooperative behavior [9].","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Horrocks","given":"J.

This study focuses on whether guarding in captive meerkats exhibits a pattern similar to that described for wild groups. Sentinel behavior in captivity has been somewhat neglected because predation is usually not a critical factor. Nonetheless, observations in captivity might reveal whether individual or group experience influences this specific behavior pattern. We observed three captive meerkat groups (in outdoor as well as indoor enclosures) and analyzed the duration of guarding sequences, the number of established guards, the guard posture, and the individual guard positions. We also conducted playback experiments to investigate the reaction of the sentinel and the group to bird calls (songbird vs. predatory bird species). The results demonstrated that captive groups behave much the same as wild groups. Certain individuals performed the guard job more often than other group members. Accordingly, the “super sentinels” observed in the wild also exist in captive groups. Playbacks showed that the sentinels reacted more strongly to the calls of predatory bird species, indicating that captive meerkats are able to categorize bird calls. We also documented major differences in behavioral responses to the calls of specific predatory bird species. Our observations underline that sentinel behavior is probably a combination of an innate, imprinted pattern that is further affected by the experience. Future studies might further investigate this influence of experience, beyond innate behavior, on the group‐specific sentinel behavior pattern in captive meerkats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Huels","given":"Florian D."},{"family":"Stoeger","given":"Angela S."}],"citation-key":"huelsSentinelBehaviorCaptive2022","container-title":"Zoo Biology","container-title-short":"Zoo Biology","DOI":"10.1002/zoo.21644","ISSN":"0733-3188, 1098-2361","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","page":"10-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sentinel behavior in captive meerkats ( <i>Suricata suricatta</i> )","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zoo.21644","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"isakssonImpactUrbanizationBirds2018","abstract":"Urban habitats and landscapes are markedly different from nonurban “natural” habitats. The major difference is the transformation of the land, from natural green areas to anthropogenic structures and impervious surfaces. To survive in the urban habitat, birds are forced to either accept or avoid the new conditions. In addition, the urban sprawl has led to a highly fragmented landscape, with islets of suitable bird habitat surrounded by highways and buildings that frequently act as barriers, even for mobile creatures such as birds. These altered conditions have changed the avifauna dramatically, with many species vanishing once an area is urbanized, thus resulting in a significant loss of local biodiversity. However, some species seem to thrive in the city, and these urban-dwelling species often show pronounced phenotypic differences (e.g., in behavior, physiology, and morphology) to their rural conspecifics. These phenotypic changes have been linked to specific urban selective drivers such as air pollution, artificial light at night, noise, different kinds of food, different predation pressures, and human disturbances. However, these drivers are often confounded, and it is hard to separate one urban factor as the main driver for the differentiation.

  {"id":"johnsonDistributedAmineModulation1995","abstract":"1. In the pyloric network of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion, graded synapses organize the network output. The amines dopamine (DA), serotonin, and octopamine each elicit a distinctive motor pattern from a quiescent pyloric network. We have examined the effects of these amines on the graded synaptic strengths between the six major types of neurons of this network to understand how amine modulation of synaptic strength contributes to the amine-induced motor patterns. Here we tested amine affects at 10 different graded chemical synapses of the pyloric network. We show that each amine has a statistically different spectrum of distributed effects across the network synapses. 2. Under our control conditions (isolated pairs of neurons, removal of modulatory input), most of the graded chemical synapses were weak and some synapses were nonfunctional. The output synapses of the ventricular dilator (VD) neuron were significantly stronger than the other synapses. 3. DA altered the synaptic strength of every graded chemical synapse. This amine strengthened the weak chemical output synapses of the anterior burster (AB), lateral pyloric (LP), and pyloric constrictor (PY) neurons and weakened (and in some cases abolished) the strong chemical output synapses of the VD neuron. The AB-->inferior cardiac neuron (IC) and PY-->IC graded chemical synapses were nonfunctional under our control conditions; DA activated these silent synapses. 4. Serotonin enhanced the AB's output chemical synapses but weakened all the other graded chemical synapses examined. Octopamine's effects were much weaker than those of the other two amines. It enhanced the AB-->LP synapse and the LP's output synapses and weakly strengthened the AB-->PY, VD-->LP, and VD-->PY synapses. 5. The amines alter the input resistance of many of the pyloric neurons, and this could contribute to the observed changes in synaptic strength by altering passive current flow between input and output sites in the cells. However, the input resistance changes were relatively small compared with the changes in synaptic strength and cannot alone account for the synaptic modulation. In some cases the sign of the input resistance change was inconsistent with the change in synaptic strength. Thus the amines appear to modify synaptic transmission directly in this system. 6. This study completes our description of amine effects on all the graded synapses of the pyloric network. We summarize our present and earlier work to show that modulators can reconfigure the entire synaptic organization of a neural network by acting at many distributed synaptic sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"B.

  {"id":"jonesUrbanizationTemporalPatterns2019","abstract":"Urbanization causes dramatic and rapid changes to natural environments, which can lead the animals inhabiting these habitats to adjust their behavioral responses. For social animals, urbanized environments may alter group social dynamics through modification of the external environment (e.g., resource distribution). This might lead to changes in how individuals associate or engage in group behaviors, which could alter the stability and characteristics of social groups. However, the potential impacts of urban habitat use, and of habitat characteristics in general, on the nature and stability of social associations remain poorly understood. Here, we quantify social networks and dynamics of group foraging behaviors of black-capped chickadees (N = 82, Poecile atricapillus), at four urban and four rural sites weekly throughout the nonbreeding season using feeders with radio frequency identification of individual birds. Because anthropogenic food sources in urban habitats (e.g., bird feeders) provide abundant and reliable resources, we predicted that social foraging associations may be of less value in urban groups, and thus would be less consistent than in rural groups. Additionally, decreased variability of food resources in urban habitats could lead to more predictable foraging patterns (group size, foraging duration, and the distribution of foraging events) in contrast to rural habitats. Networks were found to be highly consistent through time in both urban and rural habitats. No significant difference was found in the temporal clumping of foraging events between habitats. However, as predicted, the repeatability of the clumping of foraging events in time was significantly higher in urban than rural habitats. Our results suggest that individuals living in urban areas have more consistent foraging behaviors throughout the nonbreeding season, whereas rural individuals adjust their tactics due to less predictable foraging conditions. This first examination of habitat-related differences in the characteristics and consistency of social networks along an urbanization gradient suggests that anthropic habitat use results in subtle modifications in social foraging patterns. Future studies should examine potential implications of these differences for variation in predation risk, energy intake, and information flow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Teri B."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Julian C."},{"family":"Morand-Ferron","given":"Julie"}],"citation-key":"jonesUrbanizationTemporalPatterns2019","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.5060","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"4589-4602","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Urbanization and the temporal patterns of social networks and group foraging behaviors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.5060","volume":"9"},

Interpopulation differences in gross brain morphology among numerous teleost ﬁsh species have been observed and have been partially attributed to plastic changes in response to their environment, including predation. These differences manifest themselves macroscopically, potentially because teleosts retain the capacity for active neuroproliferation into adulthood. Building on previous work, showing chronic exposure to predation can affect brain morphology, we sought to determine whether these differences manifest themselves on a time scale shown to induce phenotypically plastic behavioural changes. In separate trials, we held northern redbelly dace (Phoxinus eos (Cope, 1861) = Chrosomus eos Cope, 1861) and juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus, 1758) in semi-natural conditions and exposed them to conspeciﬁc skin extract as a proxy for predation risk over 2 weeks. After exposure, their brains were excised, photographed, and analyzed for size (multivariate ANOVA) and shape (Procrustes ANOVA). Despite their brief exposure to simulated predation pressure, subjects from both species developed signiﬁcantly different brain morphologies. Compared with controls, the Atlantic salmon exhibited a different brain shape and smaller optic tecta, whereas the northern redbelly dace had larger brains with more developed olfactory bulbs and optic tecta.

Recent work in a number of systems has now demonstrated that neurons intrinsic to CPG can also evoke neuromodulatory actions on other members of the CPG. Such \"intrinsic neuromodulation\" plays a role in controlling the CPG underlying the escape swim response of the nudibrach mollusc, Tritonia diomedea. The dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) are a bilaterally represented set of three serotonergic neurons that participate in the generation of the rhythmic swim motor program. Serotonin released from these CPG neurons functions both as a fast neurotransmitter and as a slower neuromodulator. In its modulatory role, serotonin enhances the release of neurotransmitter from another CPG neuron, C2, and also increases C2 excitability by decreasing spike frequency adaptation. These neuromodulatory actions intrinsic to the CPG may be important for the initial self-configuration of the system into a function CPG and for experience-dependent changes in the output such as behavioral sensitization and habituation.","author":[{"family":"Katz","given":"P.

  {"id":"kernAnthropogenicNoiseDisrupts2016","abstract":"Anthropogenic noise is rapidly becoming a universal environmental feature. While the impacts of such additional noise on avian sexual signals are well documented, our understanding of its effect in other terrestrial taxa, on other vocalisations, and on receivers is more limited. Little is known, for example, about the influence of anthropogenic noise on responses to vocalisations relating to predation risk, despite the potential fitness consequences. We use playback experiments to investigate the impact of traffic noise on the responses of foraging dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to surveillance calls produced by sentinels, individuals scanning for danger from a raised position whose presence usually results in reduced vigilance by foragers. Foragers exhibited a lessened response to surveillance calls in traffic-noise compared to ambient-sound playback, increasing personal vigilance. A second playback experiment, using noise playbacks without surveillance calls, suggests that the increased vigilance could arise in part from the direct influence of additional noise as there was an increase in response to traffic-noise playback alone. Acoustic masking could also play a role. Foragers maintained the ability to distinguish between sentinels of different dominance class, increasing personal vigilance when presented with subordinate surveillance calls compared to calls of a dominant groupmate in both noise treatments, suggesting complete masking was not occurring. However, an acoustic-transmission experiment showed that while surveillance calls were potentially audible during approaching traffic noise, they were probably inaudible during peak traffic intensity noise. While recent work has demonstrated detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise on defensive responses to actual predatory attacks, which are relatively rare, our results provide evidence of a potentially more widespread influence since animals should constantly assess background risk to optimise the foraging-vigilance trade-off.","author":[{"family":"Kern","given":"Julie M."},{"family":"Radford","given":"Andrew N."}],"citation-key":"kernAnthropogenicNoiseDisrupts2016","container-title":"Environmental Pollution (Barking, Essex: 1987)","container-title-short":"Environ Pollut","DOI":"10.1016/j.envpol.2016.08.049","ISSN":"1873-6424","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"language":"eng","page":"988-995","PMID":"27595178","source":"PubMed","title":"Anthropogenic noise disrupts use of vocal information about predation risk","type":"article-journal","volume":"218"},

While nonhuman animals are also known to be capable of trading cooperative acts immediately for one another, more contentious is the possibility that there can be delayed rewards. We use detailed field observations, social-network analyses, and a playback experiment to demonstrate that wild dwarf mongooses provide more grooming to those groupmates who contribute more to sentinel behavior (acting as a raised guard to look out for danger). We therefore provide experimental evidence of delayed contingent cooperation, and cross-commodity exchange, in a wild nonprimate.\n          , \n            \n              Many animals participate in biological markets, with strong evidence existing for immediate cooperative trades. In particular, grooming is often exchanged for itself or other commodities, such as coalitionary support or access to food and mates. More contentious is the possibility that nonhuman animals can rely on memories of recent events, providing contingent cooperation even when there is a temporal delay between two cooperative acts. Here we provide experimental evidence of delayed cross-commodity grooming exchange in wild dwarf mongooses (\n              Helogale parvula\n              ). First, we use natural observations and social-network analyses to demonstrate a positive link between grooming and sentinel behavior (acting as a raised guard). Group members who contributed more to sentinel behavior received more grooming and had a better social-network position. We then used a field-based playback experiment to test a causal link between contributions to sentinel behavior and grooming received later in the day. During 3-h trial sessions, the perceived sentinel contributions of a focal individual were either up-regulated (playback of its surveillance calls, which are given naturally during sentinel bouts) or unmanipulated (playback of its foraging close calls as a control). On returning to the sleeping refuge at the end of the day, focal individuals received more grooming following surveillance-call playback than control-call playback and more grooming than a matched individual whose sentinel contributions were not up-regulated. We believe our study therefore provides experimental evidence of delayed contingent cooperation in a wild nonprimate species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kern","given":"Julie M."},{"family":"Radford","given":"Andrew N."}],"citation-key":"kernExperimentalEvidenceDelayed2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"kollerRobustlmmPackageRobust2016","abstract":"As any real-life data, data modeled by linear mixed-effects models often contain outliers or other contamination. Even little contamination can drive the classic estimates far away from what they would be without the contamination. At the same time, datasets that require mixed-effects modeling are often complex and large. This makes it difficult to spot contamination. Robust estimation methods aim to solve both problems: to provide estimates where contamination has only little influence and to detect and flag contamination. We introduce an R package, robustlmm, to robustly fit linear mixed-effects models. The package's functions and methods are designed to closely equal those offered by lme4, the R package that implements classic linear mixed-effects model estimation in R. The robust estimation method in robustlmm is based on the random effects contamination model and the central contamination model. Contamination can be detected at all levels of the data. The estimation method does not make any assumption on the data's grouping structure except that the model parameters are estimable. robustlmm supports hierarchical and non-hierarchical (e.g., crossed) grouping structures. The robustness of the estimates and their asymptotic efficiency is fully controlled through the function interface. Individual parts (e.g., fixed effects and variance components) can be tuned independently. In this tutorial, we show how to fit robust linear mixed-effects models using robustlmm, how to assess the model fit, how to detect outliers, and how to compare different fits.","author":[{"family":"Koller","given":"Manuel"}],"citation-key":"kollerRobustlmmPackageRobust2016","container-title":"Journal of Statistical Software","DOI":"10.18637/jss.v075.i06","ISSN":"1548-7660","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,6]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2016 Manuel Koller","page":"1-24","source":"www.jstatsoft.org","title":"Robustlmm: an R package for robust estimation of linear mixed-effects models","title-short":"Robustlmm","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v075.i06","volume":"75"},

Coordinated vigilance, including unique sentinel behavior, is rare in nature, since it is time-consuming and limited in terms of benefits. No evidence showed animals adopt alternative vigilance strategies during antipredation scanning yet. Considering the nonindependent nature of both synchronization and coordination, we assessed whether group members could keep alert synchronously or in a coordinated fashion under different circumstance. We studied how human behavior and species-specific variables impacted individual and collective vigilance of globally threatened blacknecked cranes (Grus nigricollis) and explored behavior-based wildlife management. We tested both predation risk (number of juveniles in group) and human disturbance (level and distance) effects on individual and collective antipredation vigilance of black-necked crane families. Adults spent significantly more time (proportion and duration) on scanning than juveniles, and parents with juveniles behaved more vigilant. Both adults and juveniles increased time allocation and duration on vigilance with observer proximity. Deviation between observed and expected collective vigilance varied with disturbance and predation risk from zero, but not significantly so, indicating that an independent vigilance strategy was adopted by black-necked crane couples. The birds showed synchronized vigilance in low disturbance areas, with fewer juveniles and far from observers; otherwise, they scanned in coordinated fashion. The collective vigilance, from synchronized to coordinated pattern, varied as a function of observer distance that helped us determine a safe distance of 403.75 m for the most vulnerable family groups with two juveniles. We argue that vigilance could constitute a prime indicator in behavior-based species conservation, and we suggesting a safe distance of at least 400 m should be considered in future tourist management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kong","given":"Dejun"},{"family":"Møller","given":"Anders Pape"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yanyun"}],"citation-key":"kongDisturbancePredationRisk2021","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Ecol.

This paper reviews the ways in which biodiversity is affected by urbanization and discusses the consequences of different conservation approaches. Cities can be richer in plant species, including in native species, than rural areas. Alien species can lead to both homogenization and differentiation among urban regions. Urban habitats can harbor self-sustaining populations of rare and endangered native species, but cannot replace the complete functionality of (semi-)natural remnants. While many conservation approaches tend to focus on such relict habitats and native species in urban settings, this paper argues for a paradigm shift towards considering the whole range of urban ecosystems. Although conservation attitudes may be challenged by the novelty of some urban ecosystems, which are often linked to high numbers of nonnative species, it is promising to consider their associated ecosystem services, social benefits, and possible contribution to biodiversity conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kowarik","given":"Ingo"}],"citation-key":"kowarikNovelUrbanEcosystems2011","collection-title":"Selected papers from the conference Urban Environmental Pollution: Overcoming Obstacles to Sustainability and Quality of Life (UEP2010), 20-23 June 2010, Boston, USA","container-title":"Environmental Pollution","container-title-short":"Environmental Pollution","DOI":"10.1016/j.envpol.2011.02.022","ISSN":"0269-7491","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1974-1983","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Novel urban ecosystems, biodiversity, and conservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749111000960","volume":"159"},

However, the relationship between these two theories has been plagued by controversy for almost half a century and debates about their relevance and usefulness in explaining social evolution seem to rekindle at regular intervals. Here, we first provide a concise introduction into the kin selection and multilevel selection theories and shed light onto the roots of the controversy surrounding them. We then review two major aspects of the current debate: the presumed formal equivalency of the two theories and the question whether group selection can lead to group adaptation. We conclude by arguing that the two theories can offer complementary approaches to the study of social evolution: kin selection approaches usually focus on the identification of optimal phenotypes and thus on the endresult of a selection process, whereas multilevel selection approaches focus on the ongoing selection process itself. The two theories thus provide different perspectives that might be fruitfully combined to promote our understanding of the evolution in group-structured populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kramer","given":"Jos"},{"family":"Meunier","given":"Joël"}],"citation-key":"kramerKinMultilevelSelection2016","container-title":"F1000Research","container-title-short":"F1000Res","DOI":"10.12688/f1000research.8018.1","ISSN":"2046-1402","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,28]]},"page":"F1000 Faculty Rev-776","PMCID":"PMC4850877","PMID":"27158472","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Kin and multilevel selection in social evolution: a never-ending controversy?","title-short":"Kin and multilevel selection in social evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4850877/","volume":"5"},

Individual foraging rate, predation risk, and physiologic stress vary along these gradients, resulting in growth-mortality trade-offs with depth. In the summer, Cancer borealis commonly forage in the shallow subtidal in the Gulf of Maine. C. borealis are the favored invertebrate prey of the Herring Gull and the Great Black-backed Gull, which consume 25%–50% of available C. borealis (those in <1 m water) during each daytime low tide. We investigated three possible explanations for the presence of C. borealis in the risky gull-predation zone. First, we tested whether predation risk in the gull-predation zone was matched at deeper depths by subtidal predators; we found predation risk decreases with depth. Second, we tested whether water temperatures were warmer in the gull-predation zone and whether these warmer temperatures resulted in increased growth rates. We found that, while waters were warmer in the gull-predation zone, crabs grew at similar rates above and below the thermocline when fed similar diets. Finally, we tested for differences in food availability with depth and whether these differences influenced C. borealis growth rates. Our results suggest a growth-mortality trade-off, where increased food availability provides sufficient growth benefit to outweigh the risk of foraging at shallower depths.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Krediet","given":"Cory J."},{"family":"Donahue","given":"Megan J."}],"citation-key":"kredietGrowthmortalityTradeoffsDepth2009","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jembe.2009.04.001","ISSN":"0022-0981","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5,31]]},"language":"en","page":"133-139","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Growth-mortality trade-offs along a depth gradient in Cancer borealis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098109001300","volume":"373"},

Large numbers of nonbreeding ravens are attracted to human developments and thus are spatially restricted, whereas breeding ravens are distributed more evenly throughout the area. We investigated whether the spatial distribution of risk of predation by ravens to juveniles of the threatened desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) was determined by the spatial distribution of (1) nonbreeding ravens at human developments (leading to “spillover” predation) or (2) breeding individuals throughout developed and undeveloped areas (leading to “hyperpredation”). Predation risk, measured using styrofoam models of juvenile desert tortoises, was high near places attracting large numbers of nonbreeding ravens, near successful nests, and far from successful nests when large numbers of nonbreeding ravens were present. Patterns consistent with both “spillover” predation and “hyperpredation” were thus observed, attributed to the nonbreeding and breeding segments of the population, respectively. Furthermore, because locations of successful nests changed almost annually, consistent low-predation refugia for juvenile desert tortoises were nearly nonexistent. Consequently, anthropogenic resources for ravens could indirectly lead to the suppression, decline, or even extinction of desert tortoise populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kristan III","given":"William B."},{"family":"Boarman","given":"William I."}],"citation-key":"kristaniiiSpatialPatternRisk2003","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/02-0448","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","page":"2432-2443","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Spatial Pattern of Risk of Common Raven Predation on Desert Tortoises","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/02-0448","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"kupfermannCommandNeuronConcept1978","abstract":"The notion of the command cell has been highly influential in invertebrate neurobiology, and related notions have been increasingly used in research on the vertebrate nervous system. The term “command neuron” implies that the neuron has some critical function in the generation of a normally occurring behavior. Nevertheless, most authors either explicitly or implicitly use a strictly operational definition, independent of considerations of normal behavioral function. That is, command neurons are often defined as neurons which, when stimulated by the experimenter, evoke some behavioral response. Even when utilizing such an operational definition, investigators frequently differ on what they consider to be the exact characteristics that a neuron must have (or not have) to be considered a command cell. A few authors appear to treat command neurons in relation to normal function, but a precise behaviorally relevant definition has not been specified. Because of the ambiguity in the definition of command neurons, the term can refer to a wide variety of neurons which may play divergent behavioral roles. In some ways the attempt to label a cell as a command neuron may interfere with the process of discovering the complex causal determinants of behavior. Nevertheless, the notion that individual cells are responsible for certain behaviors is highly appealing, and an attempt to define the command neuron rigorously could be worthwhile. We suggest that a command neuron be defined as a neuron that is both necessary and sufficient for the initiation of a given behavior. These criteria can by tested by: (1) establishing the response pattern of the putative command neuron during presentation of a given stimulus and execution of a well specified behavior; (2) removing the neuron and showing that the response is no longer elicited by the stimulus (necessary condition); and (3) firing the neuron in its normal pattern and showing that the complete behavioral response occurs (sufficient condition). In some cases, groups of neurons, when treated as a whole, may satisfy the necessity and sufficiency criteria for a given behavior, even though individual neurons of the group fail to meet the criteria. We suggest that such a group be termed a “command system” for the behavior in question. Individual neurons in the command system can be termed “command elements” if, when fired in their normally occurring pattern, they elicit a part of the behavior, or “modulatory elements” if they do not in isolation elicit any response, but alter the behavior produced by other elements in the command system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kupfermann","given":"Irving"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Klaudiusz R."}],"citation-key":"kupfermannCommandNeuronConcept1978","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X00059057","ISSN":"1469-1825, 0140-525X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1978",3]]},"language":"en","page":"3-10","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The command neuron concept","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/command-neuron-concept/EFA9A607C33D09A2B0BD906F189921BF","volume":"1"},

One hypothesis to explain these declines is that American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), which have increased dramatically in numbers in urban areas in recent years, may be depredating nighthawk nests. If urban crows are a factor in nighthawk declines, we predicted there would be higher rates of predation on nests in urban areas than in rural areas. We tested this hypothesis by placing and monitoring artificial nests containing Coturnix quail eggs in both urban and rural settings. Depredation of experimental clutches was significantly lower in rural, natural habitats than in the urban environment. The type of substrate on urban roofs may also be important in influencing rates of depredation, as egg-loss was more common at experimental nests on roofs with a small pea gravel substrate than on roofs covered in larger river stone. In all cases, identified predators were American Crows. While experimental predation rates may not represent actual levels of predation on natural nests, these relative differences in rates of predation suggest that urban crows may be an important contributor to declining populations of Common Nighthawks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Latta","given":"Steven C."},{"family":"Latta","given":"Krista N."}],"citation-key":"lattaUrbanAmericanCrows2015","container-title":"The Wilson Journal of Ornithology","container-title-short":"wils","DOI":"10.1676/14-181.1","ISSN":"1559-4491, 1938-5447","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9]]},"page":"528-533","publisher":"The Wilson Ornithological Society","source":"bioone.org","title":"Do urban american crows (<i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>) contribute to population declines of the common nighthawk (<i>Chordeiles minor</i>)?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bioone.org/journals/the-wilson-journal-of-ornithology/volume-127/issue-3/14-181.1/Do-Urban-American-Crows-Corvus-brachyrhynchos-Contribute-to-Population-Declines/10.1676/14-181.1.full","volume":"127"},
  {"id":"lehmann2006","abstract":"One of the enduring puzzles in biology and the social sciences is the origin and persistence of intraspecific cooperation and altruism in humans and other species. Hundreds of theoretical models have been proposed and there is much confusion about the relationship between these models. To clarify the situation, we developed a synthetic conceptual framework that delineates the conditions necessary for the evolution of altruism and cooperation. We show that at least one of the four following conditions needs to be fulfilled: direct benefits to the focal individual performing a cooperative act; direct or indirect information allowing a better than random guess about whether a given individual will behave cooperatively in repeated reciprocal interactions; preferential interactions between related individuals; and genetic correlation between genes coding for altruism and phenotypic traits that can be identified. When one or more of these conditions are met, altruism or cooperation can evolve if the cost-to-benefit ratio of altruistic and cooperative acts is greater than a threshold value. The cost-to-benefit ratio can be altered by coercion, punishment and policing which therefore act as mechanisms facilitating the evolution of altruism and cooperation.

Methods for analyzing a given model from both viewpoints would therefore be valuable. I argue that there is often an easy way to achieve this: MLS can be written using the components of KS.

This error led Wynne-Edwards to explain sustainable exploitation in animals by selection against overexploiting groups.

How strongly does group selection influence evolution? Following Price, Hamilton showed how levels of selection interact: group selection prevails if Hamilton’s rule applies. Several showed that group selection drove some major evolutionary transitions. Following Hamilton’s lead, Queller extended Hamilton’s rule, replacing genealogical relatedness by the regression on an actor’s genotypic altruism of interacting neighbours’ phenotypic altruism. Price’s theorem shows the generality of Hamilton’s rule. All instances of group selection can be viewed as increasing inclusive fitness of autosomal genomes.

Notably absent from consideration, however, is the role of private landowners and their actions, such as owning free-ranging domestic cats (Felis catus; cats allowed free access to the outdoors). To understand the impacts of cat predation on birds, we surveyed all 1694 private landowners living on three breeding bird survey (BBS) routes ($ 120 km) that represent a continuum of rural-to-urban landscapes in Southeastern Michigan, where the majority (> 90%) of land is privately owned. Our data indicate that among the 58.5% of landowners that responded, one quarter of them owned outdoor cats. On average a cat depredated between 0.7 and 1.4 birds per week. A total of 23+ species (12.5% of breeding species) were on the list of being killed, including two species of conservation concern (Eastern Bluebirds and Ruby-throated Hummingbirds). Across the three landscapes there were $ 800 to $ 3100 cats, which kill between $16,000 and $ 47,000 birds during the breeding season, resulting in a minimum of $ 1 bird killed/km/day. While the number and density (no./ha) of free-ranging cats per landowner diﬀered across the rural to urban landscapes, depredation rates were similar. Landowner participation in bird feeding showed no relationship with the number of free-ranging cats owned.

  {"id":"limaBackBasicsAntipredatory1995","abstract":"A negative relationship between group size and levels of individual vigilance is widespread in socially feeding vertebrates. The main explanation of this ‘group-size effect’, the many-eyes hypothesis, is based on the simple premise that as group size increases, there are progressively more eyes scanning the environment for predators. Thus an individual forager can devote less time to vigilance (and more time to feeding) as group size increases without any lessening of the group's ability to detect an attack. Basic to this hypothesis is the assumption of collective detection: that all members of the group are alerted to an attack as long as it is detected by at least one individual. In addition, an important presumption associated with the many-eyes hypothesis is that individuals monitor the vigilance behaviour of their groupmates in determining their own level of vigilance. Neither the idea of collective detection nor behavioural monitoring received strong support in an experimental study of vigilance in mixed flocks of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, and American tree sparrows, Spizella arborea. The lack of support for behavioural monitoring was particularly evident; however, some degree of collective detection was apparent. It is possible that anti-predatory rules-of-thumb may explain the group-size effect while keeping intact the basics of the many-eyes hypothesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lima","given":"Steven L."}],"citation-key":"limaBackBasicsAntipredatory1995","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/0003-3472(95)80149-9","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",1,1]]},"page":"11-20","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Back to the basics of anti-predatory vigilance: the group-size effect","title-short":"Back to the basics of anti-predatory vigilance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347295801499","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"limaTemporalVariationDanger1999","abstract":"The rapid response of animals to changes in predation risk has allowed behavioral ecologists to learn much about antipredator decision making. A largely unappreciated aspect of such decision making, however, is that it may be fundamentally driven by the very thing that allows it to be so readily studied: temporal variation in risk. We show theoretically that temporal variability in risk leaves animals with the problem of allocating feeding and antipredator efforts across different risk situations. Our analysis suggests that an animal should exhibit its greatest antipredator behavior in high-risk situations that are brief and infrequent. An animal should also allocate more antipredator effort to high-risk situations and more feeding to low-risk situations, with an increase in the relative degree of risk in high-risk situations. However, the need to feed leaves an animal with little choice but to decrease its allocation of antipredator effort to high-risk situations as they become more frequent or lengthy; here, antipredator effort in low-risk situations may drop to low levels as an animal allocates as much feeding as possible to brief periods of low risk. These conclusions hold under various scenarios of interrupted feeding, state-dependent behavior, and stochastic variation in risk situations. Our analysis also suggests that a common experimental protocol, in which prey animals are maintained under low risk and then exposed to a brief \"pulse\" of high risk, is likely to overestimate the intensity of antipredator behavior expected under field situations or chronic exposure to high risk.","author":[{"family":"Lima","given":"Steven L."},{"family":"Bednekoff","given":"Peter A."}],"citation-key":"limaTemporalVariationDanger1999","container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"Am Nat","DOI":"10.1086/303202","ISSN":"1537-5323","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"649-659","PMID":"29585647","source":"PubMed","title":"Temporal Variation in Danger Drives Antipredator Behavior: The Predation Risk Allocation Hypothesis","title-short":"Temporal Variation in Danger Drives Antipredator Behavior","type":"article-journal","volume":"153"},
  {"id":"liObservationsForagingBehavior2020","abstract":"Apodemus peninsulae, a dominant rodent species in temperature forests of northeastern China, is a model animal to explore the ecological functions of reciprocal coevolution of animals and plants. From August to October 2016, 24 infra-red cameras were installed to study the feeding behavior and activity patterns of A. peninsulae in its natural environment. By analyzing 5618 video records, we found that feeding behavior, followed by motor and sentinel behaviors, was their main activity. In the behavior spectra, motor behavior (creep, walk, and skip), feeding behavior (forage, feeding, transport, hoarding, and clean), and sentinel behavior (alert, flee, banishment, and coexistence) accounted for 57.96%, 40.36%, and 1.68% of their behavior, respectively. The peak of feeding behavior occurred between 18:00 and 23:00, and feeding behavior frequency, duration, and activity rhythms differ among August to October. Furthermore, activity was the greatest after sunset and before sunrise, indicating a nocturnal lifestyle; however, from August to October, the start time of the activity was earlier, and the end time was later than usual. On average, mice spent 21.6 ± 11.6 times/night feeding, with a duration of 63.58 ± 98.36 s; while they spent less time in foraging, 39.05 ± 51.63 s. We found a significant difference in feeding and foraging frequency, with mice spending on average 10.84 ± 9.85 times/ night and 9.23 ± 11.17 times/night, respectively. Our results show that feeding and foraging behavior is also influenced by light intensity, suggesting a preference for crepuscular periods of the day.

  {"id":"lopuckiChangesSocialBehavior2021","abstract":"Behavioral traits play a major role in successful adaptation of wildlife to urban conditions. However, there are few studies showing how urban conditions affect the social behavior of urban animals during their direct encounters. It is generally believed that the higher density of urban populations translates into increased aggression between individuals. In this paper, using a camera-trap method, we compared the character of direct encounters in urban and non-urban populations of the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius (Pallas, 1771), a species known as an urban adapter. We confirmed the thesis that urbanization affects the social behavior and urban and rural populations differ from each other. Urban animals are less likely to avoid close contact with each other and are more likely to show tolerant behavior. They also have a lower tendency towards monopolization of food resources. The behavior of urban animals varies depending on the time of day: in the daytime, animals are more vigilant and less tolerant than at night. Our results indicate that, in the case of the species studied, behavioral adaptation to urban life is based on increasing tolerance rather than aggression in social relations. However, the studied urban adapter retains the high plasticity of social behavior revealed even in the circadian cycle. The observation that tolerance rather than aggression may predominate in urban populations is a new finding, while most studies suggest an increase in aggression in urban animals. This opens an avenue for formulating new hypotheses regarding the social behavior of urban adapters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Łopucki","given":"Rafał"},{"family":"Klich","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Kiersztyn","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"lopuckiChangesSocialBehavior2021","container-title":"Mammalian Biology","container-title-short":"Mamm Biol","DOI":"10.1007/s42991-020-00075-1","ISSN":"1618-1476","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","source":"Springer Link","title":"Changes in the social behavior of urban animals: more aggression or tolerance?","title-short":"Changes in the social behavior of urban animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42991-020-00075-1","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"lowryBehaviouralResponsesWildlife2013","abstract":"Increased urbanization represents a formidable challenge for wildlife. Nevertheless, a few species appear to thrive in the evolutionarily novel environment created by cities, demonstrating the remarkable adaptability of some animals. We argue that individuals that can adjust their behaviours to the new selection pressures presented by cities should have greater success in urban habitats. Accordingly, urban wildlife often exhibit behaviours that differ from those of their rural counterparts, from changes to food and den preferences to adjustments in the structure of their signals. Research suggests that behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity) may be an important characteristic for succeeding in urban environments. Moreover, some individuals or species might possess behavioural traits (a particular temperament) that are inherently well suited to occupying urban habitats, such as a high level of disturbance tolerance. This suggests that members of species that are less ‘plastic’ or naturally timid in temperament are likely to be disadvantaged in high‐disturbance environments and consequently may be precluded from colonizing cities and towns.","author":[{"family":"Lowry","given":"Hélène"},{"family":"Lill","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Bob B.

Partial migration in birds was first documented for several Holarctic populations many decades ago. The evolution and maintenance of this particular migratory system have only recently been more thoroughly examined, but our knowledge and understanding of the problem is still incomplete. Currently, one of the main concerns is the fitness balancing of the two behavioural alternatives, i.e. whether migrants and residents within a population are equally fit or if one of the categories is inferior and making ‘the best of a bad situation’. Closely tied to this question is the proximate regulation of the migratory and sedentary habits. It has been suggested that a social dominance system might be powerful enough to keep this migration system going; alternatively, a pooulation might be divided into two genetically distinct morphs with different preprogrammed Migratory behaviours.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Per"}],"citation-key":"lundbergEvolutionPartialMigration1988","container-title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/0169-5347(88)90035-3","ISSN":"0169-5347","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"172-175","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The evolution of partial migration in Birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169534788900353","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"luniakSynurbizationAdaptationAnimal2004","abstract":"Recent zoology/ecology coined a new term, synurbization, as an analogy to the existing term of wider meaning – “synanthropization.” Synurbization denotes adjustment of wild animal populations to specific conditions of urban environment. The new term, was introduced by theriologists and it is accepted in ornithology as well. The term “urbanization,” in turn, should be in ecology applied for changes in landscape (or environment) caused by urban development. The growing and global tendency towards synurbization, observed recently in animal world, is a response to world-wide expansion of urban development (urbanization). More and more bird and mammal populations colonize cities, and some of them are in urban conditions much more successful than in their native natural habitats. In Europe, the best known examples are blackbird Turdus merula, magpie Pica pica, Hooded crow Corvus corone cornix, kestrel Falco tinnunculus, red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, Striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius, rabbit O. oryctolagus, red fox V. vulpes. In Warsaw, during the past few decades, at least 12 new bird species and 2 mammal species have colonized areas of high degree of urbanization. Synurbic populations show several significant ecological and behavioural differences, as compared with populations of the same species living in their native non-urban habitats. Among most typical features of synurbization are: higher density of population connected with reduction of individual (pair, family) territories, reduced migratory behaviour, prolonged breeding season (even winter broods) and other changes in breeding ecology, prolonged and changed (sometimes adversed) circadian activity, increased longevity (but worse health parameters!), changes in diet and in foraging behaviour, increased intraspecific agression, tameness toward man and various adaptations to human behaviour. All the above adjustments of synurbic populations seem to be within the range of natural plasticity of the species. The question concerning possible genetic differences between synurbic and non-urban populations has no clear answer so far. The rapid increase of the phenomenon of synurbization, which is observed in recent decades, shows chances for coexistence between wild animals and our urban civilization. It also shows possibilities for managing of wildlife in cities. But it does not change the fact, that a world ecological crisis affects the fauna in cities just as in the animal world as a whole.","author":[{"family":"Luniak","given":"Maciej"}],"citation-key":"luniakSynurbizationAdaptationAnimal2004","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Synurbization - adaptation of animal wildlife to urban development","type":"article-journal"},

Despite this widely held belief, a comprehensive review quantifying the effect of corvids on the demography of prey species is lacking. We examine the impacts of crows, ravens Corvus spp. and Eurasian Magpies Pica pica on the population parameters of other bird species. We summarize results from 42 studies, which included 326 explicit evaluations of relationships between a corvid and a potential prey species. Population parameters of studied prey species were categorized as abundance-related (numbers, nest density) or productivity-related (nest success, brood size). Information from both experimental removal studies and correlative studies was examined. Combining all studies, no negative influence of corvids on either abundance or productivity of prey species was found in 81% of cases. Negative impacts were significantly more likely in cases examining productivity rather than abundance (46 vs. 10%). Experimental studies that removed only corvid species were significantly less likely to show a positive impact on productivity than those removing corvids alongside other predators (16 vs. 60%). This suggests that the impact of corvids is smaller than that of other predators, or that compensatory predation occurs. The impact of corvids was similar between diverse avian groups (such as gamebirds, passerines and waders; or ground-nesting and other species). Crows were found to be significantly more likely to have a negative impact on prey species productivity than were Magpies (62 vs. 12%), but no differences were found in relation to prey abundance. We conclude that while corvids can have a negative impact on bird species, their impact is small overall, and nearly five times more frequent for productivity than for abundance. These results suggest that in most cases bird populations are unlikely to be limited by corvid predation and that conservation measures may generally be better targeted at other limiting factors. However, negative impacts were found in a minority of cases, and those may require further investigation to develop management tools to mitigate such impacts where they are of economic or conservation concern.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Madden","given":"Christine F."},{"family":"Arroyo","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Amar","given":"Arjun"}],"citation-key":"maddenReviewImpactsCorvids2015","container-title":"Ibis","DOI":"10.1111/ibi.12223","ISSN":"1474-919X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-16","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A review of the impacts of corvids on bird productivity and abundance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ibi.12223","volume":"157"},

Here, we describe a study in which we examined the presence and eﬀectiveness of sentinels in a wild population of the socially monogamous zebra ﬁnch (Taeniopygia guttata). We found that when experimentally approached by a human observer during incubation, birds ﬂushed from their nests at signiﬁcantly greater distances when their reproductive partner was acting as a sentinel than when the partner was absent. The distance at which birds ﬂushed was not inﬂuenced by the approach direction of the human observer, the gender of the incubating bird, the presence of conspeciﬁcs, the habitat type or the size of the breeding colony. Our results indicate that sentinels are an eﬀective anti-predator defence amongst socially monogamous birds, and may represent a neglected beneﬁt of the formation of stable social partnerships in birds.

Here, we report results of a virtual lab experiment in which 94 subjects play up to 400 ten-round games of Prisoner’s Dilemma over the course of twenty consecutive weekdays. Consistent with previous work, the typical round of first defection moves earlier for several days; however, this unravelling process stabilizes after roughly one week. Analysing individual strategies, we find that approximately 40% of players behave as resilient cooperators who avoid unravelling even at significant cost to themselves. Finally, using a standard learning model we predict that a sufficiently large minority of resilient cooperators can permanently stabilize unravelling among a majority of rational players. These results shed hopeful light on the long-term dynamics of cooperation, and demonstrate the importance of long-run experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Mao","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Dworkin","given":"Lili"},{"family":"Suri","given":"Siddharth"},{"family":"Watts","given":"Duncan J."}],"citation-key":"maoResilientCooperatorsStabilize2017","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms13800","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,13]]},"language":"en","license":"2017 The Author(s)","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cooperation;Economics;Human behaviour\nSubject_term_id: cooperation;economics;human-behaviour","number":"1","page":"13800","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Resilient cooperators stabilize long-run cooperation in the finitely repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13800","volume":"8"},

One unexplored area of study is understanding how different species’ alarms vary in quality, and how this variation is distributed in the landscape. We tested this phenomenon in a unique system of avian mixed species flocks in Amazonian rainforests: flock mates (eavesdropping species) strongly associate with alarm-calling antshrikes (genus Thamnomanes), which act as sentinel species. Up to 70 species join these flocks, presumably following antshrike behavioral cues. Since flocks in this region of the Amazon are exclusively led by a single antshrike species, this provides a unique natural system to compare differences in sentinel quality between flocks. We simulated predation threat by flying three species of live trained raptors (predators) towards flocks to compare sentinel probability to (1) produce alarm calls, and (2) encode information about magnitude and type of threat within such alarm calls. Our field experiments show significant differences in the probability of different sentinel species to produce alarm calls and distinguish predators. This variation may have important fitness consequences and shape the “landscape of fear” for eavesdropping species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Martínez","given":"A.

  {"id":"martinezFearBasedNiche2018","abstract":"Predation is a strong ecological force that shapes animal communities through natural selection. Recent studies have shown the cascading effects of predation risk on ecosystems through changes in prey behavior. Minimizing predation risk may explain why multiple prey species associate together in space and time. For example, mixed-species flocks that have been widely documented from forest systems, often include birds that eavesdrop on sentinel species (alarm calling heterospecifics). Sentinel species may be pivotal in (1) allowing flocking species to forage in open areas within forests that otherwise incur high predation risk, and (2) influencing flock occurrence (the amount of time species spend with a flock). To test this, we conducted a short-term removal experiment in an Amazonian lowland rainforest to test whether flock habitat use and flock occurrence was influenced by sentinel presence. Antshrikes (genus Thamnomanes) act as sentinels in Amazonian mixed-species flocks by providing alarm calls widely used by other flock members. The alarm calls provide threat information about ambush predators such as hawks and falcons which attack in flight. We quantified home range behavior, the forest vegetation profile used by flocks, and the proportion occurrence of other flocking species, both before and after removal of antshrikes from flocks. We found that when sentinel species were removed, (1) flock members shifted habitat use to lower risk habitats with greater vegetation cover, and (2) species flock occurrence decreased. We conclude that eavesdropping on sentinel species may allow other species to expand their realized niche by allowing them to safely forage in high-risk habitats within the forest. In allowing species to use extended parts of the forest, sentinel species may influence overall biodiversity across a diverse landscape.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Martínez","given":"Ari E."},{"family":"Parra","given":"Eliseo"},{"family":"Muellerklein","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Vredenburg","given":"Vance T."}],"citation-key":"martinezFearBasedNiche2018","container-title":"Ecology","container-title-short":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.2217","ISSN":"0012-9658, 1939-9170","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6]]},"language":"en","page":"1338-1346","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fear‐based niche shifts in neotropical birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.2217","volume":"99"},

We blended population and community ecology to investigate this possibility for 15 species of forest songbirds and their diurnal nest predators (corvids and sciurids) in 28 1 km2 sites near Seattle, Washington, from 1998 to 2004. We determined whether songbirds were positively or negatively associated with nest predators at three spatial scales, and whether their co-occurrence affected reproductive success. At the largest ‘neighborhood’ scale (1 km2 areas that included suburban and exurban development and second-growth forest remnants), nest predators and their prey were positively or negatively correlated according to general species-specific habitat associations. At the intermediate ‘forest patch’ scale (among remnant forested areas 0.5 to 70 ha), associations between predators and prey were generally weak. At the smallest ‘within patch’ scale (multiple 50 m radius survey plots within each forest patch), some songbird species avoided areas with greater predator use, particularly by Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri). Failed nests and territories tended to be in locations of higher predator occurrence (especially of corvids) than successful ones, but at the largest 1 km2 neighborhood scale relative abundance of nest predators was not correlated with the fate of nesting attempts or annual reproductive success. Reproductive success was generally high, with 52% of all nests and 49% of all territories fledging at least one young (for all species and years combined). Nest predation influenced some species' use of resources, but was not a strong influence on overall reproductive success or community structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."},{"family":"Withey","given":"John C."},{"family":"Whittaker","given":"Kara A."},{"family":"David Oleyar","given":"M."},{"family":"Unfried","given":"Thomas M."},{"family":"Rullman","given":"Stan"},{"family":"Delap","given":"Jack"}],"citation-key":"marzluffConsequencesHabitatUtilization2007","container-title":"The Condor","DOI":"10.1093/condor/109.3.516","ISSN":"1938-5129","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",8,1]]},"page":"516-534","source":"Silverchair","title":"Consequences of habitat utilization by nest predators and breeding songbirds across multiple scales in an urbanizing landscape","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/condor/109.3.516","volume":"109"},

This is occurring throughout the urbanizing world as increases by generalist omnivores, like some crows and ravens (corvids) threaten other birds with increased rates of nest predation. The process of corvid responses and their actual effects on other species is only vaguely understood, so we quantified the population response of radio-tagged American crows (\nCorvus brachyrhynchos), common ravens (\nCorvus corax), and Steller’s jays (\nCyanocitta stelleri) to human settlements and campgrounds and examined their influence as nest predators on simulated marbled murrelet (\nBrachyramphus marmoratus) nests on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula from 1995 to 2000. The behavior and demography of crows, ravens, and jays was correlated to varying degrees with proximity to human development. Crows and ravens had smaller home ranges and higher reproduction near human settlements and recreation. Annual survival of crows was positively associated with proximity to human development. Home range and reproduction of Steller’s jays was independent of proximity to human settlements and campgrounds. Local density of crows increased because home ranges of neighboring breeding pairs overlapped extensively (6× more than ravens and 3× more than Steller’s jays) and breeders far from anthropogenic foods traveled 10s of kilometers to access them. Corvids accounted for 32.5% of the predation events (\nn\n=\n837) we documented on artificial murrelet nests. Small corvids (jays) were common nest predators across our study area but their contribution as predators did not vary with proximity to settlements and campgrounds. In contrast, large corvids (crows and ravens) were rare nest predators across our study area but their contribution varied greatly with proximity to settlements and campgrounds. Managers seeking to reduce the risk of nest predation need to consider the varied impacts and variable behavioral and population responses of potential nest predators. In our situation, removing large corvids may do little to reduce overall rates of nest predation because of the diverse predator assemblage, but reducing anthropogenic food in the landscape may be effective.","author":[{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."},{"family":"Neatherlin","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"marzluffCorvidResponseHuman2006","container-title":"Biological conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2005.12.026","event-place":"Oxford","ISSN":"0006-3207","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"eng","page":"301–314","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"ocul-bu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","title":"Corvid response to human settlements and campgrounds: Causes, consequences, and challenges for conservation","title-short":"Corvid response to human settlements and campgrounds","type":"article-journal","volume":"130"},

Review of the literature and analysis of BBS, BBC, and CBC survey data showed that wintering and breeding populations of most pests have increased over the last century, despite frequent eradication campaigns against them. Great-tailed Grackles have increased most rapidly and have spread throughout the west. Gulls have increased rapidly, but have shown only minor range expansions. Corvids have increased moderately, and invaded agricultural and urban habitats. Woodpecker, Golden Eagle, Red-winged and Yellow-headed Blackbird, and Northern Mockingbird populations have remained steady or increased slightly. Tri-colored Blackbirds have declined in abundance. A key to the development of pest problems is the initial removal or conversion of natural habitat to urban or agricultural sites.

In a slight majority of studies, bird density increased, but richness and evenness decreased in response to urbanization. The most consistent effects of increasing settlement were increases in non-native species of birds, increases in birds able to nest on buildings (esp. swifts and swallows), increases in nest predation, and decreases in interior- and ground-nesting species. Effects of urbanization on hawks, owls, and cavity nesters were less consistent, in part being dependent on the surrounding habitat. The factors favoring species in urbanizing areas appear simpler than those reducing species. Increased availability of food was primary among factors benefiting species; predator reduction, reduced human persecution, and habitat enhancement were less important. Decreased habitat availability, reduced patch size, increased edge, increased non-native vegetation, decreased vegetative complexity, and increased nest predation were commonly associated with bird declines in response to human settlement. Urban planners and policy makers can profoundly affect how and where cities grow. Avian ecologists can help inform these important decisions by: 1) quantifying how the pattern of settlement affects birds and 2) understanding how bird populations and resulting communities change along entire gradients of urbanization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."}],"citation-key":"marzluffWorldwideUrbanizationIts2001","container-title":"Avian Ecology and Conservation in an Urbanizing World","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4615-1531-9_2","editor":[{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."},{"family":"Bowman","given":"Reed"},{"family":"Donnelly","given":"Roarke"}],"event-place":"Boston, MA","ISBN":"978-1-4615-1531-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","page":"19-47","publisher":"Springer US","publisher-place":"Boston, MA","source":"Springer Link","title":"Worldwide urbanization and its effects on birds","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-1531-9_2"},

We addressed this issue in crustaceans, where arterial blood Po2 is set in the 1–3 kPa range, a level that is similar to the most frequently measured tissue Po2 in the vertebrate CNS. We demonstrate that over its physiological range, O2 can reversibly modify the activity of the pyloric network in the lobster Homarus gammarus. This network is composed of 12 identified neurons that spontaneously generate a triphasic rhythmic motor output in vitro as well as in vivo. When Po2 decreased from 20 to 1 kPa, the pyloric cycle period increased by 30–40%, and the neuronal pattern was modified. These effects were all dose- and state-dependent. Specifically, we found that the single lateral pyloric (LP) neuron was responsible for the O2-mediated changes. At low Po2, the LP burst duration increased without change in its intraburst firing frequency.

  {"id":"massenToleranceRewardEquity2015","abstract":"Cooperative decision rules have so far been shown experimentally mainly in mammal species that have variable and complex social networks. However, these traits should not necessarily be restricted to mammals. Therefore, we tested cooperative problem solving in ravens. We showed that, without training, nine ravens spontaneously cooperated in a loose-string task. Corroborating findings in several species, ravens’ cooperative success increased with increasing inter-individual tolerance levels. Importantly, we found this in both a forced dyadic setting and in a group setting where individuals had an open choice to cooperate with whomever. The ravens, moreover, also paid attention to the resulting reward distribution and ceased cooperation when being cheated upon. Nevertheless, the ravens did not seem to pay attention to the behavior of their partners while cooperating and future research should reveal whether this is task specific or a general pattern. Given their natural propensity to cooperate and the results we present here, we consider ravens as an interesting model species to study the evolution of and the mechanisms underlying cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Massen","given":"Jorg J.

However, progress has been limited thus far due to differences in approaches between psychologists and behavioral ecologists. Although the former tend to use controlled experiments to pinpoint precise cognitive mechanisms, these experiments often lack ecological validity. In contrast, behavioral ecologists seek to understand the adaptive function of cooperative behavior of animals in the wild but typically neglect the underlying psychological mechanisms. Here we appraise and integrate evidence from these two approaches to understand the potential cognitive solutions to four fundamental challenges that animals face during cooperative interactions under natural conditions: (1) when to cooperate; (2) with whom to cooperate; (3) what to do in cooperative interactions; (4) how much to contribute to cooperation. We argue that an ecologically motivated approach is critical to understanding the psychological mechanisms of cooperation and how these mechanisms evolve.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"McAuliffe","given":"K."},{"family":"Thornton","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"mcauliffePsychologyCooperationAnimals2015","container-title":"Journal of Zoology","container-title-short":"J Zool","DOI":"10.1111/jzo.12204","ISSN":"0952-8369, 1469-7998","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1]]},"language":"en","page":"23-35","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The psychology of cooperation in animals: an ecological approach","title-short":"The psychology of cooperation in animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jzo.12204","volume":"295"},

Crabs were fed a radio-opaque meal and then exposed to 100% seawater (SW), 80%SW or 60%SW;passage of digesta was followed using a fluoroscope. Exposure to low salinity increased the time for food passage through the gut system. Times for emptying of the foregut, midgut and hindgut varied in a dose-dependent manner. In the lowest salinity, crabs regurgitated food from the foregut after approximately 6 h. This may act as a protective response, clearing the gut and avoiding subsequent increases in metabolism associated with digestion. Contraction rate of the cardiac stomach and gastric mill was sporadic and there was no significant change with salinity. In contrast, contractions of the pyloric region were more constant and rapid. Pyloric contractions decreased at each salinity within 2-4 h after feeding. Contraction rates of the pyloric chamber were significantly lower in 60%SW compared with 100%SW and 80%SW. During a salinity cycle there was also slowing of gut contractions and food passage through the gut system. Pre-treatment levels were only regained slowly when the animals were returned to 100%SW. Cancer gracilis was able to slow digestion during low salinity exposure, which may spare resources for other systems.

  {"id":"mcgowanDemographicBehavioralComparisons2001","abstract":"American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) have become common suburban and urban birds in the last 50 years, using these environments for roosting and breeding. I studied crows in upstate New York from 1989 to 1999, and compared reproductive success, survival, and social behavior of crows in suburban and rural areas. Although both suburban and rural crows maintained permanent territories, suburban American Crows had smaller territories and nested at higher densities. Both suburban and rural crows periodically left their territories in fall and winter to join foraging aggregations and to roost at night. The proportion of nests attended by auxiliaries did not differ, but suburban nests were attended by larger families. Overall nest success was higher in suburban areas. Success rates during the egg stage of the nest cycle did not differ between habitat, but suburban nests had higher success during the nestling stage of the nest cycle. Survival of crows post fledging was better in suburban areas, but after one year annual survival rates did not differ between the habitats. Birds raised in one habitat tended to breed in the same habitat. Although clutch sizes and egg hatchability did not differ between the habitats, rural nests produced nearly one more young per successful nest and significantly larger young than suburban crows, suggesting that food resources were better in rural areas. Data from a drought year, a time of apparent food shortage, suggested that suburban food resources also were less dependable than those in rural areas. The increase in American Crows over the last 25 years in eastern North America may be due in part to the successful exploitation of suburban nesting habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"McGowan","given":"Kevin J."}],"citation-key":"mcgowanDemographicBehavioralComparisons2001","container-title":"Avian Ecology and Conservation in an Urbanizing World","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4615-1531-9_17","editor":[{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."},{"family":"Bowman","given":"Reed"},{"family":"Donnelly","given":"Roarke"}],"event-place":"Boston, MA","ISBN":"978-1-4615-1531-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","page":"365-381","publisher":"Springer US","publisher-place":"Boston, MA","source":"Springer Link","title":"Demographic and behavioral comparisons of suburban and rural American crows","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-1531-9_17"},

  {"id":"meillereInfluenceUrbanizationBody2015","abstract":"Consistent expanding urbanization dramatically transforms natural habitats and exposes organisms to novel environmental challenges, often leading to reduced species richness and diversity in cities. However, it remains unclear how individuals are affected by the urban environment and how they can or cannot adjust to the specific characteristics of urban life (e.g. food availability). In this study, we used an integrative multi-component approach to investigate the effects of urbanization on the nutritional status of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We assessed several morphological and physiological indices of body condition in both juveniles (early post-fledging) and breeding adults from four sites with different levels of urbanization in France, Western Europe. We found that sparrows in more urbanized habitats have reduced body size and body mass compared to their rural conspecifics. However, we did not find any consistent differences in a number of complementary indices of condition (scaled mass index, muscle score, hematocrit, baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels) between urban and rural birds, indicating that urban sparrows may not be suffering nutritional stress. Our results suggest that the urban environment is unlikely to energetically constrain adult sparrows, although other urban-related variables may constrain them. On the other hand, we found significant difference in juvenile fat scores, suggesting that food types provided to young sparrows differed highly between habitats. In addition to the observed smaller size of urban sparrows, these results suggest that the urban environment is inadequate to satisfy early-life sparrows’ nutritional requirements, growth, and development. The urban environment may therefore have life-long consequences for developing birds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Meillère","given":"Alizée"},{"family":"Brischoux","given":"François"},{"family":"Parenteau","given":"Charline"},{"family":"Angelier","given":"Frédéric"}],"citation-key":"meillereInfluenceUrbanizationBody2015","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0135685","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,13]]},"language":"en","page":"e0135685","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Influence of urbanization on body size, condition, and physiology in an urban exploiter: a multi-component approach","title-short":"Influence of Urbanization on Body Size, Condition, and Physiology in an Urban Exploiter","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135685","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"mellerInterannualVariationLongterm2016","abstract":"Partial migration – a part of a population migrates and another part stays resident year-round on the breeding site – is probably the most common type of migration in the animal kingdom, yet it has only lately garnered more attention. Theoretical studies indicate that in partially migratory populations, the proportion of resident individuals (PoR) should increase in high latitudes in response to the warming climate, but empirical evidence exists for few species. We provide the first comprehensive overview of the environmental factors affecting PoR and the long-term trends in PoR by studying 27 common partially migratory bird species in Finland. The annual PoR values were calculated by dividing the winter bird abundance by the preceding breeding abundance. First, we analysed whether early-winter temperature, winter temperature year before or the abundance of tree seeds just before overwintering explains the interannual variation in PoR. Secondly, we analysed the trends in PoR between 1987 and 2011. Early-winter temperature explained the interannual variation in PoR in the waterbirds (waterfowl and gulls), most likely because the temperature affects the ice conditions and thereby the feeding opportunities for the waterbirds. In terrestrial species, the abundance of seeds was the best explanatory variable. Previous winter's temperature did not explain PoR in any species, and thus, we conclude that the variation in food availability caused the interannual variation in PoR. During the study period, PoR increased in waterbirds, but did not change in terrestrial birds. Partially migratory species living in physically contrasting habitats can differ in their annual and long-term population-level behavioural responses to warming climate, possibly because warm winter temperatures reduce ice cover and improve the feeding possibilities of waterbirds but do not directly regulate the food availability for terrestrial birds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Meller","given":"Kalle"},{"family":"Vähätalo","given":"Anssi V."},{"family":"Hokkanen","given":"Tatu"},{"family":"Rintala","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Piha","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Lehikoinen","given":"Aleksi"}],"citation-key":"mellerInterannualVariationLongterm2016","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.12486","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"570-580","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Interannual variation and long-term trends in proportions of resident individuals in partially migratory birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.12486","volume":"85"},

Using two-photon imaging and patch-clamp recordings in functional brainstem preparations of mice containing pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), we examined the actions of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1/5) on the respiratory patterns. The agonist DHPG potentiated and antagonist LY367385 depressed respiration-related activities. In the inspiratory neurons, we observed rhythmic activation of non-selective channels which had a conductance of 24 pS. Their activity was enhanced with membrane depolarization and after elevation of calcium from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. They were activated by a non-hydrolysable PIP2 analogue and blocked by flufenamate, ATP4− and Gd3+. All these properties correspond well to those of TRPM4 channels. Calcium imaging of functional slices revealed rhythmic transients in small clusters of neurons present in a network. Calcium transients in the soma were preceded by the waves in dendrites which were dependent on mGluR activation. Initiation and propagation of waves required calcium influx and calcium release from internal stores. Calcium waves activated TPRM4-like channels in the soma and promoted generation of inspiratory bursts. Simulations of activity of neurons communicated via dendritic calcium waves showed emerging activity within neuronal clusters and its synchronization between the clusters. The experimental and theoretical data provide a subcellular basis for a recently proposed group-pacemaker hypothesis and describe a novel mechanism of rhythm generation in neuronal networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Mironov","given":"S L"}],"citation-key":"mironovMetabotropicGlutamateReceptors2008","container-title":"The Journal of Physiology","container-title-short":"J Physiol","DOI":"10.1113/jphysiol.2007.149021","ISSN":"0022-3751","issue":"Pt 9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,1]]},"page":"2277-2291","PMCID":"PMC2479557","PMID":"18308826","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Metabotropic glutamate receptors activate dendritic calcium waves and TRPM channels which drive rhythmic respiratory patterns in mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2479557/","volume":"586"},

Swallows and yellowhammers had their largest territories in the fertile period of the female (nest-building and egg-laying periods) during both first and second clutches. Other species also mostly had their largest territories in the fertile period of the female with only a few species having a peak during pair formation or during the nestling period. Territory size peaked in the fertile period of the female irrespective of territory type (nest site, nest site with some food resources, or nest site with all food resources). Seven of these species had their largest territories in the fertile period of both the first and the second clutch. This pattern supports the hypothesis that prevention of extra-pair copulations is a major selective pressure causing males to maximize territory size and hence minimize the risk of intrusions and copulations by other males at the time when their female can be fertilized.

  {"id":"mollerSuccessfulCityDwellers2009","abstract":"Numerous species have adapted to the proximity of humans, and this feature is no clearer than among species that have invaded towns and cities. The characteristics of species that have successfully managed to expand their range into urban areas remain largely unexplored, although they are of general interest in a world that is increasingly urbanised. I hypothesised that widely distributed species with high dispersal abilities, species with a high rate of innovation, a high level of risk-taking, and a fast life history would have a selective advantage in habitats influenced by humans. Consistent with this hypothesis, in a comparative analysis of 39 independent evolutionary events of urbanisation of birds in the Western Palearctic (thus taking the fact that closely related species that have become urbanised are caused by common phylogenetic descent rather than convergent evolution), bird species that adapted to urban habitats were characterised by large breeding ranges, high propensity for dispersal, high rates of feeding innovation (novel ways of acquiring food), short flight distances when approached by a human, and a life history characterised by high annual fecundity and high adult survival rate. Urban species may be disproportionately resistant to parasitism and predation because they had disproportionately strong immune responses, as reflected by the size of the bursa of Fabricius, and a history of weak predation-mediated natural selection, as reflected by the force required to remove feathers from the rump. Urban species had high overall ecological success as indicated by large range size and population size and high population density. This suggests that a suite of ecological features providing them with general ecological success characterises species of birds that have successfully invaded urban environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Møller","given":"Anders Pape"}],"citation-key":"mollerSuccessfulCityDwellers2009","container-title":"Oecologia","DOI":"10.1007/s00442-008-1259-8","ISSN":"1432-1939","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"849-858","source":"Springer Link","title":"Successful city dwellers: a comparative study of the ecological characteristics of urban birds in the Western Palearctic","title-short":"Successful city dwellers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1259-8","volume":"159"},

These out-group threats are predicted to affect subsequent within-group interactions (e.g., affiliation and aggression) and individual behavior (e.g., foraging and vigilance decisions). However, experimental investigations of such consequences are rare, especially in natural conditions. We used field-based call playbacks and fecal presentations on habituated wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula)—a cooperatively breeding, territorial species—to examine postinteraction responses to the simulated threat of a rival group. Dwarf mongooses invested more in grooming of groupmates, foraged closer together, and more regularly acted as sentinels (a raised guard) after encountering indicators of rival-group presence compared to control conditions. These behavioral changes likely arise from greater anxiety and, in the case of increased vigilance, the need to seek additional information about the threat. The influence of an out-group threat lasted at least 1 h but individuals of different dominance status and sex responded similarly, potentially because all group members suffer costs if a contest with rivals is lost. Our results provide field-based experimental evidence from wild animals that out-group threats can influence within-group behavior and decision making, and suggest the need for greater consideration of the lasting impacts of social conflict.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Morris-Drake","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Kern","given":"Julie M"},{"family":"Radford","given":"Andrew N"}],"citation-key":"morris-drakeExperimentalFieldEvidence2019","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/arz095","editor":[{"family":"Barrett","given":"Louise"}],"ISSN":"1045-2249, 1465-7279","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,28]]},"language":"en","page":"1425-1435","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Experimental field evidence that out-group threats influence within-group behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/30/5/1425/5519603","volume":"30"},

In the urban landscape of Hartford, CT, red-tailed hawks established home ranges in large green spaces such as parks, golf courses, and cemeteries but also nested successfully in the commercial district of downtown and in densely built urban and suburban neighborhoods. Data collected from 11 radio-tagged breeding adult hawks indicated that year-round home ranges averaged 107.7 ha, much smaller than home ranges reported for hawks inhabiting rural areas. Most hawk home ranges had multiple core areas that were usually associated with favored perches or larger patches of ‘usable’ green space, defined as patches ≥0.25 ha in size, and home range size was positively associated with larger usable green space patches in core areas. Most nests were located in the largest core area and were within a larger patch of green space within the largest core area. Rather than just the amount or size of green space patches, the value of urban green spaces for these hawks likely also varies with the number and proximity of suitable perches such as buildings or tall trees, types and density of prey, and amount of human activity in and adjacent to these spaces. Territoriality and intraspecific competition may also influence home range size and dispersion of red-tailed hawks nesting in Hartford. In this urban area, mortality due to ingestion of rodenticides and collisions with vehicles affected hawk reproductive success.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Morrison","given":"Joan L."},{"family":"Gottlieb","given":"Isabel G.

  {"id":"murakami2021","abstract":"Human crowds provide paradigmatic examples of collective behavior emerging through self-organization. Understanding their dynamics is crucial to help manage mass events and daily pedestrian transportation. Although recent findings emphasized that pedestrians’ interactions are fundamentally anticipatory in nature, whether and how individual anticipation functionally benefits the group is not well understood. Here, we show the link between individual anticipation and emergent pattern formation through our experiments of lane formation, where unidirectional lanes are spontaneously formed in bidirectional pedestrian flows. Manipulating the anticipatory abilities of some of the pedestrians by distracting them visually delayed the collective pattern formation. Moreover, both the distracted pedestrians and the nondistracted ones had difficulties avoiding collisions while navigating. These results imply that avoidance maneuvers are normally a cooperative process and that mutual anticipation between pedestrians facilitates efficient pattern formation. Our findings may influence various fields, including traffic management, decision-making research, and swarm dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Murakami","given":"Hisashi"},{"family":"Feliciani","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Nishiyama","given":"Yuta"},{"family":"Nishinari","given":"Katsuhiro"}],"citation-key":"murakami2021","container-title":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.abe7758","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,17]]},"page":"eabe7758","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"science.org (Atypon)","title":"Mutual anticipation can contribute to self-organization in human crowds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe7758","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"mureIntrinsicallyPhotosensitiveRetinal2021","abstract":"Light profoundly affects our mental and physical health. In particular, light, when not delivered at the appropriate time, may have detrimental effects. In mammals, light is perceived not only by rods and cones but also by a subset of retinal ganglion cells that express the photopigment melanopsin that renders them intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). ipRGCs participate in contrast detection and play critical roles in non-image-forming vision, a set of light responses that include circadian entrainment, pupillary light reflex (PLR), and the modulation of sleep/alertness, and mood. ipRGCs are also found in the human retina, and their response to light has been characterized indirectly through the suppression of nocturnal melatonin and PLR. However, until recently, human ipRGCs had rarely been investigated directly. This gap is progressively being filled as, over the last years, an increasing number of studies provided descriptions of their morphology, responses to light, and gene expression. Here, I review the progress in our knowledge of human ipRGCs, in particular, the different morphological and functional subtypes described so far and how they match the murine subtypes. I also highlight questions that remain to be addressed. Investigating ipRGCs is critical as these few cells play a major role in our well-being. Additionally, as ipRGCs display increased vulnerability or resilience to certain disorders compared to conventional RGCs, a deeper knowledge of their function could help identify therapeutic approaches or develop diagnostic tools. Overall, a better understanding of how light is perceived by the human eye will help deliver precise light usage recommendations and implement light-based therapeutic interventions to improve cognitive performance, mood, and life quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Mure","given":"Ludovic S."}],"citation-key":"mureIntrinsicallyPhotosensitiveRetinal2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Neurology","ISSN":"1664-2295","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells of the Human Retina","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2021.636330","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"olsonExploringEvolutionTradeoff2015","abstract":"Even though grouping behaviour has been actively studied for over a century, the relative importance of the numerous proposed fitness benefits of grouping remain unclear. We use a digital model of evolving prey under simulated predation to directly explore the evolution of gregarious foraging behaviour according to one such benefit, the ‘many eyes’ hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, collective vigilance allows prey in large groups to detect predators more efficiently by making alarm signals or behavioural cues to each other, thereby allowing individuals within the group to spend more time foraging. Here, we find that collective vigilance is sufficient to select for gregarious foraging behaviour as long there is not a direct cost for grouping (e.g. competition for limited food resources), even when controlling for confounding factors such as the dilution effect. Furthermore, we explore the role of the genetic relatedness and reproductive strategy of the prey and find that highly related groups of prey with a semelparous reproductive strategy are the most likely to evolve gregarious foraging behaviour mediated by the benefit of vigilance. These findings, combined with earlier studies with evolving digital organisms, further sharpen our understanding of the factors favouring grouping behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Olson","given":"Randal S."},{"family":"Haley","given":"Patrick B."},{"family":"Dyer","given":"Fred C."},{"family":"Adami","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"olsonExploringEvolutionTradeoff2015","container-title":"Royal Society Open Science","DOI":"10.1098/rsos.150135","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9]]},"page":"150135","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Exploring the evolution of a trade-off between vigilance and foraging in group-living organisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150135","volume":"2"},

All floaters acted as sentinels and uttered ‘alarm calls’. This suggests that sentinel activity is due at least, in part, to selfish motives. Floaters sentinelled less than they did as group members, with the decrease in sentinel activity sharper for ex-dominants than for ex-subordinates. One possible explanation for these differences is that sentinel activity is aimed not only at detecting predators, but also at detecting foreign conspecifics. Within a group, the latter incentive is stronger for breeding dominants than for subordinates, whereas all floaters alike may be trying to detect the owners of the territory in which they were roaming but also to avoid being detected by them. Other possible explanations are that floaters have less time and energy for sentinel activity because they are weaker or because foraging is more difficult in a foreign territory. This may be especially so for dominants who used to enjoy privileged access to food in their group. No significant difference was found in the rate of sentinels' ‘alarm calls’ between floaters and group members, suggesting that their main purpose is predator–prey communication, of which warning groupmates may be a side benefit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ostreiher","given":"Roni"},{"family":"Heifetz","given":"Aviad"}],"citation-key":"ostreiherSentinelBehaviourArabian2017","container-title":"Royal Society Open Science","container-title-short":"R.

  {"id":"ostreiherSentinelingforagingTradeoffDominant2019","abstract":"Many cooperative breeders forage under predation risks, sentineling is a central activity, and groupmates have to balance between sentineling and foraging. The optimal balance between sentinel activity and foraging may differ among dominant and subordinate individuals, as dominants are more efficient foragers. Two theoretical models pertain to this balance and predict when individuals with different foraging abilities should switch between the two activities on the basis of their energetic state. In one of these models, individuals must attain a critical energetic level by dusk to pass the night, and in the second model fitness is monotonically increasing with the energetic state. We tested these models in the cooperatively breeding Arabian babbler, Turdoides squamiceps. We measured the length of sentinel bouts and the gaps between them both in natural conditions and following experimental feeding. Following feeding ad libitum, subordinates expanded their sentinel bouts significantly more than dominants in comparison with natural conditions. These findings are consistent with the first model, but not with the second. In the experiment, we measured the mass of mealworms consumed by each individual following a sentinel bout relative to its body mass. This ratio was larger for subordinates, indicating that they ended their sentinel bouts at a lower energetic state than dominants. This finding is consistent with the second model, but not with the first. Immediately after eating ad libitum, in 62% of the cases the first behavior performed by the babblers was a new sentinel bout, but in 17% it was a mutual interaction with a groupmate, indicating that social interactions also play a role in the trade‐off vis‐à‐vis sentinel activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ostreiher","given":"Roni"},{"family":"Heifetz","given":"Aviad"}],"citation-key":"ostreiherSentinelingforagingTradeoffDominant2019","container-title":"Ethology","container-title-short":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1111/eth.12833","editor":[{"family":"Koenig","given":"W."}],"ISSN":"01791613","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2]]},"language":"en","page":"98-105","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The sentineling-foraging trade-off in dominant and subordinate arabian babblers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eth.12833","volume":"125"},

A lack of specific food and shelter resources has led to the urban bird community being dominated by generalist species, while specialist species show decline. Urbanized birds differ in the behavioral traits, showing an increase in song frequency and amplitude, and bolder behavior, as compared to rural populations of the same species. Differential food resources and predatory pressure results in changes in life history traits, including prolonged breeding duration, and increases in clutch and brood size to compensate for lower survival.

In the wild, parrots show cooperative behaviours such as bi-parental care and mobbing. In this study, we tested cooperative problem solving in African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus). Our birds were tested using several experimental setups to explore the different levels of behavioural organisation between participants, differing in temporal and spatial complexity. In our experiments, African grey parrots were able to act simultaneously but mostly failed during the delay task, maybe because of a lack of inhibitory motor response. Confronted with the possibility to adapt their behaviour to the presence or absence of a partner, they showed that they were able to coordinate their actions. They also collaborated, acting complementarily in order to solve tasks, but they were not able to place themselves in the partner’s role.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Péron","given":"F."},{"family":"Rat-Fischer","given":"L."},{"family":"Lalot","given":"M."},{"family":"Nagle","given":"L."},{"family":"Bovet","given":"D."}],"citation-key":"peronCooperativeProblemSolving2011","container-title":"Animal Cognition","container-title-short":"Anim Cogn","DOI":"10.1007/s10071-011-0389-2","ISSN":"1435-9456","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"545-553","source":"Springer Link","title":"Cooperative problem solving in African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-011-0389-2","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"phillipsLekBehaviourBirds1990","abstract":"Male lek display in birds may reduce nest-related predation by decoying predators away from nests and alerting incubating females when a predator is approaching. The sentinel/decoy model predicts a region of decreased predator density just inside the maximum range at which predators are attracted by displaying males.

Well-documented features of female mate choice in lekking species, including repeated visits to male display sites prior to mating, mate fidelity and mate copying, are consistent with females maximizing the proposed antipredator benefit. The sentinel/decoy model makes a number of unique predictions that will facilitate critical tests of the model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"John B."}],"citation-key":"phillipsLekBehaviourBirds1990","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80422-1","ISSN":"00033472","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990",3]]},"language":"en","page":"555-565","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lek behaviour in birds: do displaying males reduce nest predation?","title-short":"Lek behaviour in birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347205804221","volume":"39"},

We tested whether the association between rufous hornero (Furnarius rufus) and the chalkbrowed mockingbird (Mimus saturninus) affects the foraging and alert/sentinel behaviors of both species. We also evaluated the influence of group size on these behaviors. During 60 h of observations on each species, the association was studied in a periurban area in Brazil with scan samplings. The presence of F. rufus increased the frequency of foraging while reducing the time that M. saturninus dedicated to alert/sentinel behaviors. For F. rufus, however, the presence of M. saturninus did not affect the studied behaviors, although a different study pointed out that this species could also benefit from the association with M. saturninus, indicating that both species may occasionally be positively affected by the association with each other.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Piassi","given":"Priscila M."},{"family":"Batisteli","given":"Augusto F."},{"family":"Gussoni","given":"Carlos O.

  {"id":"pollockIntegratedBehaviouralStable2017","abstract":"Animals often show reduced reproductive success in urban compared to adjacent natural areas. The lower availability and quality of natural food in cities is suggested as one key limiting factor. However, only few studies have provided conclusive support by simultaneously assessing food availability, diet and fitness. We consolidate this evidence by taking a holistic approach, comparing blue tits breeding in forest, suburban and urban areas. We (a) assessed arthropod availability, (b) investigated parental provisioning behaviour, (c) inferred diet through stable isotope analysis, and (d) measured reproductive success. At the urban site, we found a significant reduction in caterpillar availability, the main food source of blue tits, and consequently urban tits fed their offspring with fewer caterpillars than forest and suburban birds. Stable isotope analysis confirmed that diet in the urban area was fundamentally different than in the other sites. Reproductive success was lower in both urban and suburban sites compared to the forest site, and was positively associated with volume of provisioned caterpillars. Our findings provide strong integrative evidence that urban blue tit nestlings are not receiving a suitable diet, and this may be an important limiting factor for urban populations of this and potentially many other species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Pollock","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Capilla-Lasheras","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"McGill","given":"Rona A.

Participants wore eye-tracking glasses with embedded cameras and devices to measure physiological signals including heart rate and skin conductance. We found that overt signals such as smiles, laughter, eye gaze or the mimicry of those signals were not significantly associated with attraction. Instead, attraction was predicted by synchrony in heart rate and skin conductance between partners, which are covert, unconscious and difficult to regulate.

One of the best documented responses to recent climate change is alterations in the migratory behavior of birds, but the mechanisms underlying these phenotypic adjustments are largely unknown. This knowledge is still crucial to predict whether populations of migratory birds will adapt to a rapid increase in temperature. We monitored migratory behavior in a population of blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) to test for evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Using a common garden experiment in time and captive breeding we demonstrated a genetic reduction in migratory activity and evolutionary change in phenotypic plasticity of migration onset. An artificial selection experiment further revealed that residency will rapidly evolve in completely migratory bird populations if selection for shorter migration distance persists. Our findings suggest that current alterations of the environment are favoring birds wintering closer to the breeding grounds and that populations of migratory birds have strongly responded to these changes in selection. The reduction of migratory activity is probably an important evolutionary process in the adaptation of migratory birds to climate change, because it reduces migration costs and facilitates the rapid adjustment to the shifts in the timing of food availability during reproduction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Pulido","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Berthold","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"pulidoCurrentSelectionLower2010","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0910361107","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",4,20]]},"language":"en","page":"7341-7346","PMID":"20368446","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Current selection for lower migratory activity will drive the evolution of residency in a migratory bird population","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/107/16/7341","volume":"107"},

To this aim, we first tested the null hypothesis of no association between foraging individuals of the diurnal rodent, Octodon degus and their pairwise relatedness (six microsatellite loci), under natural conditions. Secondly, we examined the influence of relatedness on scan effort (percent overlapping) and temporal distribution of scanning using linear regression. Finally, we evaluated whether temporal distributions of scanning were significantly lower (coordination) or higher (synchrony) than random expectations using bootstrapping. We found that pairwise relatedness between focal degus and their foraging partner did not influence the scan effort or the temporal distribution of scanning. These original, fieldbased findings imply that vigilance behavior in socially foraging degus is unlikely to be kin-selected and adds to results from previous lab studies in that kinship remains a poor predictor of social behavior in these animals. Overall, our study adds to others revealing that kin selection may not have had an impact on aspects of social behavior such as vigilance during social foraging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Quirici","given":"Verónica"},{"family":"Palma","given":"Macarena"},{"family":"Sobrero","given":"Raúl"},{"family":"Faugeron","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Ebensperger","given":"Luis A."}],"citation-key":"quiriciRelatednessDoesNot2013","container-title":"acta ethologica","container-title-short":"acta ethol","DOI":"10.1007/s10211-012-0131-3","ISSN":"0873-9749, 1437-9546","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-8","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Relatedness does not predict vigilance in a population of the social rodent <i>Octodon degus</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10211-012-0131-3","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"radfordHigherBetterSentinel2009","abstract":"In all social species, information relevant to survival and reproduction can be obtained in two main ways: through personal interaction with the environment (i.e. ‘personal’ information) and from the performance of others (i.e. ‘public’ information). While public information is less costly to obtain than personal information, it may be inappropriate or inaccurate. When deciding how much to rely on public information, individuals should therefore assess its potential quality, but this possibility requires empirical testing in animals. Here, we use the sentinel system of cooperatively breeding pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) to investigate how behavioural decisions of foragers are influenced by potential variation in the quality of anti-predator information from a vigilant groupmate. When sentinels moved to a higher position, from where their probability of detecting predators is likely to be greater, foragers reduced their vigilance, spread out more widely and were more likely to venture into the open. Consequently, they spent more time foraging and increased their foraging efficiency, resulting in a profound increase in biomass intake rate. The opposite behavioural changes, and consequent foraging outcomes, were found when sentinels moved lower. A playback experiment demonstrated that foragers can use vocal cues alone to assess sentinel height. This is the first study to link explicitly a measure of the potential quality of public information with a fitness measure from those relying on the information, and our results emphasize that a full understanding of the evolution of communication in complex societies requires consideration of the reliability of information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Radford","given":"Andrew N."},{"family":"Hollén","given":"Linda I."},{"family":"Bell","given":"Matthew B.V."}],"citation-key":"radfordHigherBetterSentinel2009","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2009.0187","issue":"1666","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4]]},"page":"2437-2442","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"The higher the better: sentinel height influences foraging success in a social bird","title-short":"The higher the better","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2009.0187","volume":"276"},

  {"id":"raihaniResolvingIteratedPrisoner2011","abstract":"Pairs of unrelated individuals face a prisoner’s dilemma if cooperation is the best mutual outcome, but each player does best to defect regardless of his partner’s behaviour. Although mutual defection is the only evolutionarily stable strategy in one-shot games, cooperative solutions based on reciprocity can emerge in iterated games. Among the most prominent theoretical solutions are the so-called bookkeeping strategies, such as tit-for-tat, where individuals copy their partner’s behaviour in the previous round. However, the lack of empirical data conforming to predicted strategies has prompted the suggestion that the iterated prisoner’s dilemma (IPD) is neither a useful nor realistic basis for investigating cooperation. Here, we discuss several recent studies where authors have used the IPD framework to interpret their data. We evaluate the validity of their approach and highlight the diversity of proposed solutions. Strategies based on precise accounting are relatively uncommon, perhaps because the full set of assumptions of the IPD model are rarely satisfied. Instead, animals use a diverse array of strategies that apparently promote cooperation, despite the temptation to cheat. These include both positive and negative reciprocity, as well as long-term mutual investments based on ‘friendships’. Although there are various gaps in these studies that remain to be filled, we argue that in most cases, individuals could theoretically benefit from cheating and that cooperation cannot therefore be explained with the concept of positive pseudo-reciprocity. We suggest that by incorporating empirical data into the theoretical framework, we may gain fundamental new insights into the evolution of mutual reciprocal investment in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Raihani","given":"N.

Most forms of cooperative behavior have energetic costs and previous studies have shown that the contributions of individuals to alloparental provisioning are conditional on their food intake. However, the effect of naturally occurring, extreme environmental conditions on the persistence of costly forms of cooperative behaviors and their coordination by communication remain unknown. Here, we show that in meerkats (Suricata suricatta) the probability to act as sentinel, a cooperative vigilance behavior, was the same for typically occurring dry and wet conditions, but significantly reduced during a drought condition with almost no rain, especially in young individuals, members of small groups and groups with pups. The duration an individual stayed on sentinel guard, however, was most reduced during dry conditions. Besides reductions in sentinel behavior, the vocal coordination of foraging meerkats differed when comparing drought and wet conditions. Individuals responded more strongly to playbacks of sentinel “all-clear” calls and close calls, resulting in less vigilance and more foraging behavior during the drought condition. We conclude that while meerkats are adapted to commonly occurring dry periods with low rainfall, the extreme drought period with almost no rain, led to a decrease of the frequency of costly forms of cooperative behaviors in favor of behaviors that maximize direct fitness benefits and also affected the vocal coordination among group members.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Rauber","given":"Ramona"},{"family":"Clutton-Brock","given":"Tim H"},{"family":"Manser","given":"Marta B"}],"citation-key":"rauberDroughtDecreasesCooperative2019","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","container-title-short":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/arz112","ISSN":"1045-2249","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,8]]},"page":"1558-1566","source":"Silverchair","title":"Drought decreases cooperative sentinel behavior and affects vocal coordination in meerkats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arz112","volume":"30"},

The most predictable environmental cue which organisms use to time reproduction is the photoperiod, but food, temperature, and humidity may play role as a crucial factors. Urbanization is greatly increasing phenomenon and leads to change in landscape and habitat destruction for wildlife and brings extra hours of light at night (LAN), altering the natural signal of light and darkness, hence the temperature and availability of food.

Each pattern corresponds to a specific behavioural situation: pattern 1 is only observed in unfed lobsters and feeding invariably produces a switch from pattern 1 to pattern 2 (Fig. 3).3.The two pyloric patterns differ in the period of the cycle (Fig. 4), the burst duration of the constrictors (Fig. 5), the latency of firing of the constrictors in the cycle (Fig. 6) and the phase of the constrictors in the cycle (Fig. 7). Correlation between period and constrictor latency is weak in pattern 1 and strong in pattern 2 (Fig. 8).4.The two pyloric patterns can be recorded from in vitro preparations only when the stomatogastric ganglion (i.e. the CPG) is connected to the more rostral commissural ganglia (Fig. 9).5.At least in pattern 1, cycling of the constrictors can occur when the dilators (known as pacemakers in the CPG) are silent (Fig. 10).6.For these reasons, we concluded that a commissural oscillator could be participating in the organization of the pyloric output. However, the synaptic relationships which exist between the motor neurones (i.e. the CPG) cannot be neglected (Fig. 11) and this suggests that, in the intact animal, the motor output is organized by the cooperation of a premotor oscillator and a motor oscillator.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rezer","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Moulins","given":"Maurice"}],"citation-key":"rezerExpressionCrustaceanPyloric1983","container-title":"Journal of comparative physiology","container-title-short":"J.

Similar to other cooperative behaviours, variation in investment in sentinel behaviour should reflect variation in the benefits of such behaviour. However, evidence for this is inconclusive: to date experiments have manipulated the cost of sentinel behaviour, and considerations of changes in the benefits of sentinel activity on investment patterns are lacking. Here, we experimentally manipulated the benefits of sentinel behaviour in the cooperatively breeding pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor) to assess whether this had any impact on sentinel activity. We simulated the presence of an unseen predator using playbacks of heterospecific alarm calls, and the presence of an actual predator using a model snake. In both cases, the increase in perceived predation risk caused an increase in sentinel activity, demonstrating that investment in sentinel activity increases when the benefits are greater.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ridley","given":"A.

  {"id":"ridleySentinelBehaviourSafe2013","abstract":"Sentinel behaviour, where individuals take turns to watch for danger and give alarm calls to approaching predators, has been observed in a number of animal societies. However, the evolutionary causes of this behaviour remain unclear. There are two main, competing hypotheses regarding the evolution of sentinel behaviour. The first hypothesis is that it is a cooperative behaviour, where group members benefit from the detection of danger but share the workload of acting as a sentinel. The second is that it is a safe, selfish behaviour. Under the second hypothesis, once an individual is satiated, being a sentinel is safer because sentinels can detect threats more readily and can therefore escape from predators faster. We examined whether sentinels are safer than foragers in a wild, free-living cooperative bird (the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor) with a well-described sentinel system. We found that sentinel behaviour was costly because (1) sentinels were targeted by predators more often, (2) they were further from cover than foragers, and (3) they took longer to reach the safety of cover following a predator alarm. These results suggest that individuals do not become sentinels because it is safer. This is the first study to demonstrate that sentinels are at greater risk of predator attack than foraging group members and suggests sentinel activity may have evolved as a form of cooperative behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ridley","given":"Amanda R."},{"family":"Nelson-Flower","given":"Martha J."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Alex M."}],"citation-key":"ridleySentinelBehaviourSafe2013","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.017","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"page":"137-142","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Is sentinel behaviour safe?

  {"id":"riehl2016","abstract":"Cheaters—genotypes that gain a selective advantage by taking the benefits of the social contributions of others while avoiding the costs of cooperating—are thought to pose a major threat to the evolutionary stability of cooperative societies. In order for cheaters to undermine cooperation, cheating must be an adaptive strategy: cheaters must have higher fitness than cooperators, and their behaviour must reduce the fitness of their cooperative partners. It is frequently suggested that cheating is not adaptive because cooperators have evolved mechanisms to punish these behaviours, thereby reducing the fitness of selfish individuals. However, a simpler hypothesis is that such societies arise precisely because cooperative strategies have been favoured over selfish ones—hence, behaviours that have been interpreted as ‘cheating’ may not actually result in increased fitness, even when they go unpunished. Here, we review the empirical evidence for cheating behaviours in animal societies, including cooperatively breeding vertebrates and social insects, and we ask whether such behaviours are primarily limited by punishment. Our review suggests that both cheating and punishment are probably rarer than often supposed. Uncooperative individuals typically have lower, not higher, fitness than cooperators; and when evidence suggests that cheating may be adaptive, it is often limited by frequency-dependent selection rather than by punishment. When apparently punitive behaviours do occur, it remains an open question whether they evolved in order to limit cheating, or whether they arose before the evolution of cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Riehl","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Frederickson","given":"Megan E."}],"citation-key":"riehl2016","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2015.0090","issue":"1687","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,5]]},"page":"20150090","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Cheating and punishment in cooperative animal societies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2015.0090","volume":"371"},

  {"id":"rosenbaumGradedTransmissionAction2018","abstract":"Neurons in the central pattern-generating circuits in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) release neurotransmitter both as a graded function of presynaptic membrane potential that persists in TTX and in response to action potentials. In the STG of the male crab Cancer borealis, the modulators oxotremorine, C. borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP1a), red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH), proctolin, TNRNFLRFamide, and crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) produce and sustain robust pyloric rhythms by activating the same modulatory current (IMI), albeit on different subsets of pyloric network targets. The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine, and the peptides CabTRP1a and RPCH elicited rhythmic triphasic intracellular alternating fluctuations of activity in the presence of TTX. Intracellular waveforms of pyloric neurons in oxotremorine and CabTRP1a in TTX were similar to those in the intact rhythm, and phase relationships among neurons were conserved. Although cycle frequency was conserved in oxotremorine and TTX, it was altered in CabTRP1a in the presence of TTX. Both rhythms were primarily driven by the pacemaker kernel consisting of the Anterior Burster and Pyloric Dilator neurons. In contrast, in TTX the circuit remained silent in proctolin, TNRNFLRFamide, and CCAP. These experiments show that graded synaptic transmission in the absence of voltage-gated Na+ current is sufficient to sustain rhythmic motor activity in some, but not other, modulatory conditions, even when each modulator activates the same ionic current. This further demonstrates that similar rhythmic motor patterns can be produced by qualitatively different mechanisms, one that depends on the activity of voltage-gated Na+ channels, and one that can persist in their absence., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The pyloric rhythm of the crab stomatogastric ganglion depends both on spike-mediated and graded synaptic transmission. We activate the pyloric rhythm with a wide variety of different neuromodulators, all of which converge on the same voltage-dependent inward current. Interestingly, when action potentials and spike-mediated transmission are blocked using TTX, we find that the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine and the neuropeptide CabTRP1a sustain rhythmic alternations and appropriate phases of activity in the absence of action potentials. In contrast, TTX blocks rhythmic activity in the presence of other modulators. This demonstrates fundamental differences in the burst-generation mechanisms in different modulators that would not be suspected on the basis of their cellular actions at the level of the targeted current.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosenbaum","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Marder","given":"Eve"}],"citation-key":"rosenbaumGradedTransmissionAction2018","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J Neurosci","DOI":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2632-17.2018","ISSN":"0270-6474","issue":"42","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,17]]},"page":"8976-8988","PMCID":"PMC6191523","PMID":"30185461","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Graded Transmission without Action Potentials Sustains Rhythmic Activity in Some But Not All Modulators That Activate the Same Current","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6191523/","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"rothsteinDistinctionsReciprocalAltruism1988","abstract":"Reciprocal altruism is usually regarded as distinct from kin selection. However, because reciprocators are likely to establish long-term relations and to deliver most of their aid to other individuals genetically predisposed to reciprocation, most acts of reciprocal altruism should involve indirect increments to inclusive fitness, at least as regards alleles for reciprocation. Thus, as usually defined, reciprocal altruism is not clearly distinct from kin selection because both involve indirect increments to inclusive fitness. We propose a new definition for reciprocal altruism that makes the phenomenon distinct from kin selection and allows for reciprocation between nonrelatives in which current costs exceed future benefits returned to the reciprocal altruist. Cooperation and reciprocal altruism are often considered synonymous or different only in the timing of donating and receiving aid. We show, however, that there are other critical differences between reciprocal altruism and other forms of cooperation, most importantly, the latter often involve no clearly identifiable aid. We propose a four-category system to encompass the range of cooperative and beneficent behaviors that occur in nature (reciprocal altruism, pseudoreciprocity, simultaneous cooperation and by-product beneficence). Reciprocal altruism must involve aid that is returned to an original donor as a result of behavior that has a net cost to an original recipient. Our simplest category of cooperative/beneficent behavior, “by-product beneficence,” occurs when a selfish act also benefits another individual and requires no prior or subsequent interactions between the individuals involved. By-product beneficence may be the primitive state from which more complicated types of cooperative/beneficent behavior evolved. We show via simple models that by-product beneficence can allow for the initial increase of helping behavior in a completely unstructured population although the individuals showing such behavior pay all the costs while sharing the benefits with other individuals. Previous models that attempted to explain the initial increase of cooperative/beneficent behavior were much more complex and were based on the prisoner's dilemma, which does not accurately reflect most forms of cooperation and beneficence that occur in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Rothstein","given":"Stephen I."},{"family":"Pierotti","given":"Raymond"}],"citation-key":"rothsteinDistinctionsReciprocalAltruism1988","container-title":"Ethology and Sociobiology","container-title-short":"Ethology and Sociobiology","DOI":"10.1016/0162-3095(88)90021-0","ISSN":"0162-3095","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"189-209","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Distinctions among reciprocal altruism, kin selection, and cooperation and a model for the initial evolution of beneficent behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309588900210","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"ruiz-gutierrezOverwinteringStrategiesMigratory2016","abstract":"Our understanding of movement patterns in wildlife populations has played an important role in current ecological knowledge and can inform landscape conservation decisions. Direct measures of movement can be obtained using marked individuals, but this requires tracking individuals across a landscape or multiple sites. We demonstrate how movements can be estimated indirectly using single-site, capture–mark–recapture (CMR) data with a multi-state open robust design with state uncertainty model (MSORD-SU). We treat residence and transience as two phenotypic states of overwintering migrants and use time- and state-dependent probabilities of site entry and persistence as indirect measures of movement. We applied the MSORD-SU to data on eight species of overwintering Neotropical birds collected in 14 countries between 2002 and 2011. In addition to entry and persistence probabilities, we estimated the proportions of residents at a study site and mean residence times. We identified overwintering movement patterns and residence times that contrasted with prior categorizations of territoriality. Most species showed an evidence of residents entering sites at multiple time intervals, with transients tending to enter between peak resident movement times. Persistence and the proportion of residents varied by latitude, but were not always positively correlated for a given species. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that migratory songbirds commonly move among habitats during the overwintering period. Substantial proportions of populations appear to be comprised of transient individuals, and residents tend to persist at specific sites for relatively short periods of time. This information on persistence and movement patterns should be explored for specific habitats to guide landscape management on the wintering grounds, such as determining which habitats are conserved or restored as part of certification programmes of tropical agroforestry crops. We suggest that research and conservation efforts on Neotropical migrant songbirds focus on identifying landscape configurations and regional habitat networks that support these diverse overwintering strategies to secure full life cycle conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruiz-Gutierrez","given":"Viviana"},{"family":"Kendall","given":"William L."},{"family":"Saracco","given":"James F."},{"family":"White","given":"Gary C."}],"citation-key":"ruiz-gutierrezOverwinteringStrategiesMigratory2016","container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.12655","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"1035-1045","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Overwintering strategies of migratory birds: a novel approach for estimating seasonal movement patterns of residents and transients","title-short":"Overwintering strategies of migratory birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.12655","volume":"53"},

Subsequent morphological and electrophysiological evidence has strongly supported our hypotheses that some ICC populations are gut pacemakers and may hold other fundamental regulatory functions (coordinative, mechanoreceptive, mediating nervous input). Recognition of common principles of ICC organization (confinement to specific locations in relation to smooth muscle layers; formation of extensive cellular networks through tight coupling of overlapping thin processes; innervation patterns; characteristic patterns of contact with smooth muscle cells) and ultrastructure (myoid features: basal lamina, caveolae, rich in sER and mitochondria, often prominent filament bundles and dense bands/bodies) has allowed the identification of ICC in the GI musculature of all species investigated. However, variation in organization and ultrastructure is significant, between both species and regions of the GI tract.

  {"id":"sachs2004","abstract":"Darwin recognized that natural selection could not favor a trait in one species solely for the benefit of another species. The modern, selfish‐gene view of the world suggests that cooperation between individuals, whether of the same species or different species, should be especially vulnerable to the evolution of noncooperators. Yet, cooperation is prevalent in nature both within and between species. What special circumstances or mechanisms thus favor cooperation? Currently, evolutionary biology offers a set of disparate explanations, and a general framework for this breadth of models has not emerged. Here, we offer a tripartite structure that links previously disconnected views of cooperation. We distinguish three general models by which cooperation can evolve and be maintained: (i) directed reciprocation—cooperation with individuals who give in return; (ii) shared genes—cooperation with relatives (e.g., kin selection); and (iii) byproduct benefits—cooperation as an incidental consequence of selfish action. Each general model is further subdivided. Several renowned examples of cooperation that have lacked explanation until recently—plant‐rhizobium symbioses and bacteria‐squid light organs—fit squarely within this framework. Natural systems of cooperation often involve more than one model, and a fruitful direction for future research is to understand how these models interact to maintain cooperation in the long term.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Sachs","given":"Joel L"},{"family":"Mueller","given":"Ulrich G"},{"family":"Wilcox","given":"Thomas P"},{"family":"Bull","given":"James J"}],"citation-key":"sachs2004","container-title":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","DOI":"10.1086/383541","ISSN":"0033-5770","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",6]]},"page":"135-160","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"The Evolution of Cooperation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/383541","volume":"79"},

The treatment successfully elevated circulating glucocorticoid levels but did not result in significant changes in pup feeding or sentinel behavior. Females, however, spent less time foraging when glucocorticoid levels were elevated and appeared to spend more time in close proximity to pups.

  {"id":"scheidPerformanceRooksCooperative2010","abstract":"In recent years, an increasing number of studies demonstrated the existence of consistent individual differences in behaviour, often referred to as differences in temperament or personality, in a wide range of animal species. There notably is a growing body of evidence showing that individuals differ in their propensity for risk taking or reacting to stressful situations. This variation has been related to differences in learning abilities or performance in cognitive tasks. In the present study, we examined the consequences of inter-individual variation in boldness on performance in a cooperative task in rooks (Corvus frugilegus). Birds were tested individually to measure a number of behavioural parameters related to boldness. The level of a stress-related hormone, corticosterone, in the faeces of each bird was measured under control conditions and after a stress-provoking event. In parallel, we conducted a cooperative string pulling task in which birds were tested in dyads. Successful cooperation depended to a large extent on the temperament of the two partners involved. Temperament, in turn, correlated well with corticosterone levels under stress. Bolder individuals appeared to be more willing to participate in the task, whereas shyer individuals were more influenced by the behaviour of their partner. These findings suggest that a rook’s temperament can limit its options of forming successfully cooperating partnerships under stressful conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheid","given":"Christelle"},{"family":"Noë","given":"Ronald"}],"citation-key":"scheidPerformanceRooksCooperative2010","container-title":"Animal Cognition","container-title-short":"Anim Cogn","DOI":"10.1007/s10071-009-0305-1","ISSN":"1435-9456","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"545-553","source":"Springer Link","title":"The performance of rooks in a cooperative task depends on their temperament","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-009-0305-1","volume":"13"},

Furthermore, the pressures hypothesized to have favoured social intelligence in primates also apply to corvids. We tested cooperative problem-solving in rooks to compare their performance and cognition with primates. Without training, eight rooks quickly solved a problem in which two individuals had to pull both ends of a string simultaneously in order to pull in a food platform. Similar to chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys, performance was better when within-dyad tolerance levels were higher. In contrast to chimpanzees, rooks did not delay acting on the apparatus while their partner gained access to the test room. Furthermore, given a choice between an apparatus that could be operated individually over one that required the action of two individuals, four out of six individuals showed no preference. These results may indicate that cooperation in chimpanzees is underpinned by more complex cognitive processes than that in rooks. Such a difference may arise from the fact that while both chimpanzees and rooks form cooperative alliances, chimpanzees, but not rooks, live in a variable social network made up of competitive and cooperative relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Seed","given":"Amanda M"},{"family":"Clayton","given":"Nicola S"},{"family":"Emery","given":"Nathan J"}],"citation-key":"seedCooperativeProblemSolving2008","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2008.0111","issue":"1641","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,22]]},"page":"1421-1429","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Cooperative problem solving in rooks (Corvus frugilegus)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2008.0111","volume":"275"},

As the process of habitat urbanization bears impact on more and more natural habitats, it is essential for us to understand the changes we bring forth in the ecological forces shaping urban animal communities. Birds are perhaps the most frequently studied model organisms by urban ecologists. It is a well known general pattern that urban avian communities have typically reduced species richness, while the density of a few successful species is often higher in cities than in adjacent more natural habitats. But it is less understood which mechanisms generate and uphold these community-level changes. In this review we discuss the most important components of the urban environment influencing birds’ physiology, behaviour or morphology, and compile several recent studies to illustrate their effects. To understand urban food webs we also review the results of bottom-up and top-down approach which suggest that altered food availability and predation may play key roles in forming recent urban bird communities.

Besides modulating the phenolic content, chitosan treatment also induced modifications in several target genes encoding key enzymes and transporters involved in secondary metabolic pathways. For instance, the genes PAL, CHS, F3H, ANR, UFGT, ABCC1, GST, MATE1 were upregulated in leaves and berry skins at veraison cessation in response to chitosan treatment.

  {"id":"soofiPhaseMaintenanceRhythmic2014","abstract":"Central-pattern-generating neural circuits function reliably throughout an animal's life, despite constant molecular turnover and environmental perturbations. Fluctuations in temperature pose a problem to the nervous systems of poikilotherms because their body temperature follows the ambient temperature, thus affecting the temperature-dependent dynamics of various subcellular components that constitute neuronal circuits. In the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system, the pyloric circuit produces a triphasic rhythm comprising the output of the pyloric dilator, lateral pyloric, and pyloric constrictor neurons. In vitro, the phase relationships of these neurons are maintained over a fourfold change in pyloric frequency as temperature increases from 7°C to 23°C. To determine whether these temperature effects are also found in intact crabs, in the presence of sensory feedback and neuromodulator-rich environments, we measured the temperature dependence of the pyloric frequency and phases in vivo by implanting extracellular electrodes into Cancer borealis and Cancer pagurus and shifting tank water temperature from 11°C to 26°C. Pyloric frequency in the intact crab increased significantly with temperature (Q10 = 2–2.5), while pyloric phases were generally conserved. For a subset of the C. borealis experiments, animals were subsequently dissected and the stomatogastric ganglion subjected to a similar temperature ramp in vitro. We found that the maximal frequency attained at high temperatures in vivo is lower than it is under in vitro conditions. Our results demonstrate that, over a wide temperature range, the phases of the pyloric rhythm in vivo are generally preserved, but that the frequency range is more restricted than it is in vitro.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Soofi","given":"Wafa"},{"family":"Goeritz","given":"Marie L."},{"family":"Kispersky","given":"Tilman J."},{"family":"Prinz","given":"Astrid A."},{"family":"Marder","given":"Eve"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"soofiPhaseMaintenanceRhythmic2014","container-title":"Journal of Neurophysiology","container-title-short":"J Neurophysiol","DOI":"10.1152/jn.00906.2013","ISSN":"0022-3077","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,15]]},"page":"2603-2613","PMCID":"PMC4044431","PMID":"24671541","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Phase maintenance in a rhythmic motor pattern during temperature changes in vivo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4044431/","volume":"111"},

  {"id":"squiresVigilanceBehaviorHarlequin2007","abstract":"Males of several avian species are more vigilant than their female partners, particularly during the preincubation period. Male vigilance may function as a deterrent of extrapair copulation attempts (EPCs) or to ensure male survival, because males of sexually dimorphic species may be more conspicuous to predators than females. However, vigilant males may act as antipredator sentinels to enhance female survivorship, which may also allow females to feed and rest more efficiently, thereby enhancing their ability to form clutches. We attempted to distinguish between the “male benefits” and “female benefits” hypotheses by studying the behavior of unpaired males and paired Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) during the preincubation period. Paired males were, on average, four times more vigilant than unpaired males and their mates, which suggests that elevated levels of vigilance by paired males does not function primarily for self-protection against predators. Males were not more vigilant during the female’s fertile period, contrary to the “paternity assurance” hypothesis. Male vigilance during feeding bouts was highest when pairs fed alone near shore—a condition in which feeding was likely more “risky.” Male vigilance was positively correlated with female feeding when females fed near shore, but not at other times. During resting bouts, males were vigilant 14 ± 0.01% of the time in all conditions. We suggest that male vigilance may be important to enhance female survival, especially when females feed under risky conditions.Comportement de Vigilance chez Histrionicus histrionicus durant la Période de Pré- incubation au Labrador: Les Mâles Sont-ils Vigilants pour Eux-mêmes ou pour leur Partenaire Social?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Squires","given":"Kelly A."},{"family":"Martin","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Goudie","given":"R.

Long-lasting augmentation of the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs)quickens and strengthens the muscle response to a given motor pattern. We used the muscle gm6 of the crab Cancer pagurus to study the functional consequences and temporal dynamics of facilitation and augmentation. This stomach muscle is driven by the rhythmic activity of the gastric mill central pattern generator in the stomatogastric nervous system. We tested the response of this muscle to rhythmic motor drive using a variety of gastric mill-like stimulations.EJPs recorded in muscle gm6 were initially small but are summated and facilitated strongly with continuous stimulation. Facilitation increased with shorter interspike intervals and possessed a time constant of decay &lt;1 s.During gastric mill rhythms, motor neuron activity was by contrast represented by bursts of activity with intermittent pauses of several seconds. Recordings in intact animals and in the isolated nervous system showed a great variability in firing frequency and temporal distribution of motor neuron bursts. Train stimulations with various stimulus frequencies (5 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz) and inter-train intervals (2 s, 4 s, 8 s, 16 s, 32 s) revealed that augmentation acted in addition to facilitation. Augmentation increased muscle EJPs during stimulations with inter-train intervals of 16 s or less. The effects of augmentation increased with shorter inter-train intervals, but were independent of stimulus frequency.Augmentation also contributed to the electrical response of the muscle during gastric mill rhythms, which were obtained in vitro and in vivo, and was also reflected by an increase of muscle force and the slope of force development during repetitive train stimulation. We conclude that the augmentation of EJPs at the neuromuscular junction tunes the muscle response to support force production during rhythmic motor patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Stein","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Smarandache","given":"Carmen R."},{"family":"Nickmann","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Hedrich","given":"Ulrike B.

The crustacean stomatogastric nervous system is one of the premier systems to study neuromodulation and its effects on motor pattern generation at the cellular level. It contains the extensively modulated central pattern generators that drive the gastric mill (chewing) and pyloric (food filtering) rhythms. Neuromodulators affect all stages of neuronal processing in this system, from membrane currents and synaptic transmission in network neurons to the properties of the effector muscles. The ease with which distinct neurons are identified and their activity is recorded in this system has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms by which neuromodulators affect their target cells and modulatory neuron function. Recent evidence suggests that neuromodulators are involved in homeostatic processes and that the modulatory system itself is under modulatory control, a fascinating topic whose surface has been barely scratched.

Despite immense theoretical interest, little empirical evidence substantiates the biological importance of reciprocal altruism in non-human animals. We propose that this is because psychological mechanisms constrain its application in cooperative contexts. In particular, we contend that cognitive limitations such as temporal discounting, numerical discrimination and memory make reciprocity difficult for animals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Stevens","given":"Jeffrey R."},{"family":"Hauser","given":"Marc D."}],"citation-key":"stevensWhyBeNice2004","container-title":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences","container-title-short":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.tics.2003.12.003","ISSN":"1364-6613","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"60-65","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Why be nice?

  {"id":"sueidzhdjoVigilanceBehaviorHarlequin","abstract":"AяѠѡџюѐѡ.—Males of several avian species are more vigilant than their female partners, particularly during the preincubation period. Male vigilance may function as a deterrent of extrapair copulation aĴempts (EPCs) or to ensure male survival, because males of sexually dimorphic species may be more conspicuous to predators than females. However, vigilant males may act as antipredator sentinels to enhance female survivorship, which may also allow females to feed and rest more eﬃciently, thereby enhancing their ability to form clutches. We aĴempted to distinguish between the “male beneﬁts” and “female beneﬁts” hypotheses by studying the behavior of unpaired males and paired Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) during the preincubation period. Paired males were, on average, four times more vigilant than unpaired males and their mates, which suggests that elevated levels of vigilance by paired males does not function primarily for self-protection against predators. Males were not more vigilant during the female’s fertile period, contrary to the “paternity assurance” hypothesis. Male vigilance during feeding bouts was highest when pairs fed alone near shore—a condition in which feeding was likely more “risky.” Male vigilance was positively correlated with female feeding when females fed near shore, but not at other times. During resting bouts, males were vigilant 14 ± 0.01% of the time in all conditions. We suggest that male vigilance may be important to enhance female survival, especially when females feed under risky conditions.

  {"id":"swiftWildAmericanCrows2015","abstract":"While a growing number of animals demonstrate avoidance of areas associated with conspecific death, the extent to which wild populations may use these experiences to learn about novel predators remains unclear. Here we demonstrate with experiments that wild American crows, Corvus brachyrhynchos, respond to dead conspecifics by mobbing, increasing the time to approach food in areas associated with these events, and learning new predators based on their proximity to dead crows and hawks. Avoidance of either dead conspecifics or areas associated with them is not shared by another urban bird, the rock pigeon, Columba livia. Crows mobbed and increased the time to approach food over the next 72h after observing novel humans paired with a dead crow, a red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis, or a hawk with a dead crow. The sight of a dead pigeon did not elicit these responses. These findings suggest that, for crows, dead conspecifics, but not dead heterospecifics, represent a salient danger akin to the observation of a predator. On the day the stimulus was presented, the number of trials that resulted in mobbing and avoidance of the food was strongest when crows were presented a hawk with a dead crow. In addition, we demonstrate that crows use the proximity of a human to predators, to dead conspecifics and to predators with dead conspecifics as cues to learn to recognize and subsequently scold the associated human after only one training event, and that this association can last 6 weeks. Together, our results support previous findings that crows learn places associated with conspecific death, and further demonstrate that crows can learn and remember people who appear complicit in these events.\n•We examined whether crows learn places and predators associated with conspecific death.•Crows took longer to approach food in areas associated with conspecific death.•Crows scolded humans previously seen near a dead crow, a hawk and a hawk with a dead crow.•A hawk with a dead crow elicited the strongest immediate antipredator behaviours.•Dead pigeons did not elicit similar antipredator responses in crows or pigeons.","author":[{"family":"Swift","given":"Kaeli N."},{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."}],"citation-key":"swiftWildAmericanCrows2015","container-title":"Animal behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.08.021","ISSN":"0003-3472","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"eng","page":"187–197","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","source":"ocul-bu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","title":"Wild American crows gather around their dead to learn about danger","type":"article-journal","volume":"109"},

  {"id":"tangRobustnessRhythmicCircuit2012","abstract":"Recent computational and experimental work has shown that similar network performance can result from variable sets of synaptic and intrinsic properties. Because temperature is a global perturbation that differentially influences every biological process within the nervous system, one might therefore expect that individual animals would respond differently to temperature. Nonetheless, the phase relationships of the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis, are remarkably invariant between 7 and 23°C (Tang et al., 2010). Here, we report that, when isolated STG preparations were exposed to more extreme temperature ranges, their networks became nonrhythmic, or “crashed”, in a reversible fashion. Animals were acclimated for at least 3 weeks at 7, 11, or 19°C. When networks from the acclimated animals were perturbed by acute physiologically relevant temperature ramps (11–23°C), the network frequency and phase relationships were independent of the acclimation group. At high acute temperatures (>23°C), circuits from the cold-acclimated animals produced less-regular pyloric rhythms than those from warm-acclimated animals. At high acute temperatures, phase relationships between pyloric neurons were more variable from animal to animal than at moderate acute temperatures, suggesting that individual differences across animals in intrinsic circuit parameters are revealed at high temperatures. This shows that individual and variable neuronal circuits can behave similarly in normal conditions, but their behavior may diverge when confronted with extreme external perturbations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Lamont S."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Adam L."},{"family":"Rinberg","given":"Anatoly"},{"family":"Marder","given":"Eve"}],"citation-key":"tangRobustnessRhythmicCircuit2012","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

Cooperative predator defense can enhance nest success and adult survival but, because it is inherently risky, dynamic risk assessment theory predicts that individuals modify defense behavior according to the risk posed by the predator. Parental investment theory, on the other hand, predicts that reproductive payoffs (brood value) determine investment in nest defense. We propose that, in cooperative breeders, fitness benefits deriving from the survival of other group members may additionally influence defense behavior (social group benefits theory). We tested predictions of these theories in the cooperatively breeding purple-crowned fairy-wren, Malurus coronatus, where brood value is higher for breeders, but social group benefits more important for helpers. We recorded experimentally induced individual defense behaviors in response to predator models presented near nests, representing differing levels of threat to nests and adults. As predicted, 1) individuals engaged in less risky defenses when encountering a more dangerous predator (dynamic risk assessment theory); 2) individuals defended older broods more often, and breeders defended more than helpers (parental investment theory); and 3) helpers were more likely to respond to a predator of adults (social group benefits theory).

Similar results are found when the hyperstriatum ventrale is lumped with a second DVR structure, the neostriatum. In simple correlations, size of the wulst and the striatopallidal complex is associated with feeding innovation rate, but the two structures are eliminated from the multiple regressions.

  {"id":"torresortizProblemsolvingCooperativeTask2020","abstract":"Cooperation is a complex behaviour found in many kinds of organisms and occurs between individuals of the same and different species. Several studies have examined the intentionality of this behaviour by testing the animals’ understanding of the need for a partner when working in pairs. The mammalian species tested express such understanding, whereas most tested birds fail, especially when the test involves a delayed access to the setup by one of the co-operators. In the present study, the cooperative problem-solving capability of four peach-fronted conures (Eupsittula aurea) was investigated with the loose string test. All four parrots solved the paradigm by simultaneously pulling the ends of the same string to bring a platform with a food reward within reach. They were also capable of solving the task when one of the co-operators was delayed, even when visually isolated from each other. To further test their comprehension and to exclude the birds relying on task-associated cues, we video-recorded the trials and quantified possible cues and strategies for timing the pulling behaviour (e.g., sound of the partner’s door when opening, sound of steps of partner approaching). The preferred cue to start pulling was to wait for their partner’s arrival to the string. The number of vocalisations was significantly higher during visually isolated conditions and for successful trials compared to failed trials, suggesting possible information exchange. Our findings show that peach-fronted conures can solve a cooperative task, and that cooperation success is not determined by external cues or by partner identity or affinity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Torres Ortiz","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Corregidor Castro","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Balsby","given":"Thorsten Johannes Skovbjerg"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Ole Næsbye"}],"citation-key":"torresortizProblemsolvingCooperativeTask2020","container-title":"Animal Cognition","container-title-short":"Anim Cogn","DOI":"10.1007/s10071-019-01331-9","ISSN":"1435-9456","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"265-275","source":"Springer Link","title":"Problem-solving in a cooperative task in peach-fronted conures (Eupsittula aurea)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-019-01331-9","volume":"23"},

Nevertheless, detailed movement data are unavailable for most partial migrant species. We examined migration strategies of the American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), a partially migratory species that overwinters in large communal roosts, from which some birds migrate north to breed. We used a combination of satellite telemetry, isotopic signatures (δ2H), and molecular markers (33 microsatellites) to describe and characterize the migratory movements of individuals from overwintering roosts on the east coast (Utica, New York) and west coast (Davis, California) of the United States. We collected 11,951 data points from 18 satellite-tagged individuals between 2014 and 2018, among which 14 (77.8%) were migratory (8 of 11 and 6 of 7 birds on the west and east coasts, respectively). Migration distances were 280–1,095 km and 177–793 km on the west and east coasts, respectively. Individual birds were consistent in their migratory behavior across years, and breeding-site fidelity was high: both migratory and resident birds returned to the same location in the breeding season of each year. Both isotopic signatures and molecular markers could generally differentiate residents from long-distance migrants (i.e. those breeding at latitudes >3.5°N of the resident populations), but they did not consistently differentiate residents from migrants with shorter migration distances. Overall, these data on the migratory movements of American Crows and the proportion of migrants in their roosts can serve as a baseline against which to test predictions about how partial migrants will respond to environmental alterations such as climate change and urbanization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Townsend","given":"Andrea K."},{"family":"Frett","given":"Blaire"},{"family":"McGarvey","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Taff","given":"Conor C."}],"citation-key":"townsendWhereWinterCrows2018","container-title":"The Auk","container-title-short":"tauk","DOI":"10.1642/AUK-18-23.1","ISSN":"0004-8038, 1938-4254","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8]]},"page":"964-974","publisher":"American Ornithological Society","source":"bioone.org","title":"Where do winter crows go?

Presence of carrion and hooded crows was affected by the environmental factors that modulate the party size component of fission–fusion dynamics and thereby influence social complexity.\nAbstract\nSocial complexity arises from the formation of social relationships like social bonds and dominance hierarchies. In turn, these aspects may be affected by the degree of fission–fusion dynamics, i.e., changes in group size and composition over time. Whilst fission–fusion dynamics has been studied in mammals, birds have received comparably little attention, despite some species having equally complex social lives. Here, we investigated the influence of environmental factors on aspects of fission–fusion dynamics in a free-ranging population of carrion and hooded crows (Corvus corone ssp.) in the urban zoo of Vienna, Austria over a 1-year period. We investigated 1) the size and 2) spatio-temporal structure of the local flock, and 3) environmental influences on local flock and subgroup size. The local flock size varied considerably over the year, with fewest birds being present during the breeding season. The spatio-temporal structure of the local flock showed 4 distinct presence categories, of which the proportions changed significantly throughout the year. Environmental effects on both local flock and subgroup size were time of day, season, temperature, and weather, with additional pronounced effects of the structure of the surroundings and age class on subgroup size. Our findings show environmental influences on party size at the local flock and subgroup level, as well as indications of structured party composition in respect to the 4 presence categories.

  {"id":"uttara2012","abstract":"Urbanization refers to general increase in population and the amount of industrialization of a settlement. It includes increase in the number and extent of cities. It symbolizes the movement of people from rural to urban areas. Urbanization happens because of the increase in the extent and density of urban areas. Due to uncontrolled urbanization in India, environmental degradation has been occurring very rapidly and causing many problems like land insecurity, worsening water quality, excessive air pollution, noise and the problems of waste disposal. This paper emphasizes on the effect of urbanization on environmental components mainly climate, biosphere, land and water resources. A case study of urbanization in India and metropolitan cities have been carried out leading to conclude on the existing causes of damage to the environment due to urbanization and preventive measures to keep a check on them. Although it is impossible to restrict urbanization it has to be ensured that urbanization proceeds in the right path causing minimum impact on environment.","author":[{"family":"Uttara","given":"S"},{"family":"Bhuvandas","given":"Nishi"},{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Vanita"}],"citation-key":"uttara2012","container-title":"IJREAS","container-title-short":"IJREAS","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,13]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Impacts of urbanisation on environment","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

Working memory encompasses the capacity to retain immediately past information, to process this information, and to use it to guide goal-directed behavior. Corvid songbirds are renowned for their high-level cognitive capabilities, but where and how visual information is temporarily retained by neurons in the avian brain in a behaviorally relevant way remains poorly understood. We trained four carrion crows (Corvus corone) on versions of a delayed match-to-sample task that required the crows to remember a visual stimulus for later comparison. While the crows performed the task, we recorded the activity of single neurons in the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), a pallial association area of the avian endbrain. We show that many NCL neurons encode information about visual stimuli and temporarily maintain this information after the stimulus disappeared by sustained delay activity. Selective delay activity allows the birds to hold relevant information in memory and correlates with discrimination behavior. This suggests that sustained activity of NCL neurons is a neuronal correlate of visual working memory in the corvid brain and serves to bridge temporal gaps, thereby offering a workspace for processing immediately past visual information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Veit","given":"Lena"},{"family":"Hartmann","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Nieder","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"veitNeuronalCorrelatesVisual2014","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J Neurosci","DOI":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0612-14.2014","ISSN":"0270-6474","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,4]]},"page":"7778-7786","PMCID":"PMC6608265","PMID":"24899702","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Neuronal Correlates of Visual Working Memory in the Corvid Endbrain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6608265/","volume":"34"},

The evolutionary history of amphibians and reptiles is placed in perspective by tracing the evolution of early tetrapods during and after the transition from water to land. The earliest tetrapods were anamniotes and were tied more or less to water for reproduction. These organisms gave rise to the amphibians that we know today. The transition to land was facilitated by the evolution of the amniotic egg, which allowed reproduction away from water and resulted in diversification of the amniotes. Ultimately, the amniotes gave rise to extant reptiles (including birds) and mammals.

  {"id":"vuorisaloUrbanDevelopmentAvian2003","abstract":"The hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix) colonised Turku and Helsinki, two cities in southern Finland, in the first half of the 20th century as a breeding species. Their urban population densities, however, remained low for decades, in spite of considerable changes in the urban environment. Since the 1960s, the breeding populations have increased very rapidly in both cities. The possible causes of the early colonisation of cities, the long period of low population density, and the recent rapid population increases are discussed based on environmental history data. The establishment of city parks in the 19th century was probably a prerequisite for initial colonisation, although it cannot alone explain the timing of colonisation. Hooded crow populations did not increase before the 1960s, although biological waste production increased considerably and large landfills were continuously available near both cities. In Turku, the rapid increase of the crow population took place after the availability of biological waste in the main landfill had decreased due to opening of a municipal waste incinerator. Suitable habitats created by urban expansion and a lack of predators in cities during the breeding season may have promoted urbanisation. The main factor promoting urban population growth has probably been decreased persecution in cities since the 1960s. Low levels of persecution in urban areas have facilitated the habituation of crows to humans and traffic, and probably explain the recent colonisation of city centres as breeding habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Vuorisalo","given":"Timo"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Harri"},{"family":"Hugg","given":"Timo"},{"family":"Lahtinen","given":"Rauno"},{"family":"Laaksonen","given":"Hannu"},{"family":"Lehikoinen","given":"Esa"}],"citation-key":"vuorisaloUrbanDevelopmentAvian2003","container-title":"Landscape and Urban Planning","DOI":"10.1016/S0169-2046(02)00124-X","ISSN":"0169-2046","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",1,10]]},"language":"en","page":"69-87","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Urban development from an avian perspective: causes of hooded crow (<i>Corvus corone cornix</i>) urbanisation in two Finnish cities","title-short":"Urban development from an avian perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920460200124X","volume":"62"},

Yet, to date, biotic factors have seldom been tested as sources of transgenerational effects in plants. In a greenhouse experiment with the generalist annual Polygonum persicaria, we tested for effects of parental competition on offspring by growing isogenic parent plants either individually or in competitive arrays and comparing their seedling progeny in contrasting growth environments. Offspring of competing vs. non-competing parents showed significantly altered development, resulting in greater biomass and total leaf area, but only when growing in neighbor or simulated canopy shade, rather than sunny dry conditions. A follow-up experiment in which parent plants instead competed in dry soil found that offspring in dry soil had slightly reduced growth, both with and without competitors. In neither experiment were effects of parental competition explained by changes in seed provisioning, suggesting a more complex mode of regulatory inheritance. We hypothesize that parental competition in moist soil (i.e., primarily for light) confers specific developmental effects that are beneficial for light-limited offspring, while parental competition in dry soil (i.e., primarily for belowground resources) produces offspring of slightly lower overall quality. Together, these results indicate that competitive conditions during the parental generation can contribute significantly to offspring variation, but these transgenerational effects will depend on the abiotic resources available to both parents and progeny.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Waterman","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Sultan","given":"Sonia E."}],"citation-key":"watermanTransgenerationalEffectsParent2021","container-title":"Ecology","container-title-short":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.3531","ISSN":"0012-9658, 1939-9170","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,7]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transgenerational effects of parent plant competition on offspring development in contrasting conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3531"},

However, whether regulation of sensory feedback to these projection neurons is consistent across different versions of the same motor pattern driven by the same motor system was not known. We found that gating of sensory feedback to projection neurons is determined by the modulatory state of the motor system, and not simply by whether the system is active or inactive., Sensory feedback influences motor circuits and/or their projection neuron inputs to adjust ongoing motor activity, but its efficacy varies. Currently, less is known about regulation of sensory feedback onto projection neurons that control downstream motor circuits than about sensory regulation of the motor circuit neurons themselves. In this study, we tested whether sensory feedback onto projection neurons is sensitive only to activation of a motor system, or also to the modulatory state underlying that activation, using the crab Cancer borealis stomatogastric nervous system. We examined how proprioceptor neurons (gastropyloric receptors, GPRs) influence the gastric mill (chewing) circuit neurons and the projection neurons (MCN1, CPN2) that drive the gastric mill rhythm. During gastric mill rhythms triggered by the mechanosensory ventral cardiac neurons (VCNs), GPR was shown previously to influence gastric mill circuit neurons, but its excitation of MCN1/CPN2 was absent. In this study, we tested whether GPR effects on MCN1/CPN2 are also absent during gastric mill rhythms triggered by the peptidergic postoesophageal commissure (POC) neurons. The VCN and POC pathways both trigger lasting MCN1/CPN2 activation, but their distinct influence on circuit feedback to these neurons produces different gastric mill motor patterns. We show that GPR excites MCN1 and CPN2 during the POC-gastric mill rhythm, altering their firing rates and activity patterns. This action changes both phases of the POC-gastric mill rhythm, whereas GPR only alters one phase of the VCN-gastric mill rhythm. Thus sensory feedback to projection neurons can be gated as a function of the modulatory state of an active motor system, not simply switched on/off with the onset of motor activity., NEW & NOTEWORTHY Sensory feedback influences motor systems (i.e., motor circuits and their projection neuron inputs).

Results from a computer simulation which apportions the relative selective advantage of vampire bat food sharing to kin selection and reciprocal altruism are then presented. The results demonstrate that the increase in individual survivorship due to reciprocal food sharing events in this species provides a greater increase in inclusive fitness than can be attributed to aiding relatives.

Multilevel selection theory (including group selection) provides an elegant theoretical foundation for sociobiology in the future, once its turbulent past is appropriately understood.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"David Sloan"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Edward O."}],"citation-key":"wilsonRethinkingTheoreticalFoundation2007","container-title":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","DOI":"10.1086/522809","ISSN":"0033-5770","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",12,1]]},"page":"327-348","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Rethinking the Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/522809","volume":"82"},

  {"id":"witheyDispersalJuvenileAmerican2005","abstract":"American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) populations are increasing across North America, often at high rates in urban areas. A monthly survey of American Crows in the Seattle Christmas Bird Count (CBC) circle suggested that winter counts reflected American Crow abundance at other times of the year, so we used CBC results for American Crows as a measure of population trend. In the Seattle area, local survival and fecundity appear unable to account for exponential population growth. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile dispersal from outlying suburban and exurban areas contributes to growth in the urban population by radiotagging 56 juveniles 5–46 km away from the central business district of Seattle and tracking their movements. Juvenile American Crows’ centers of activity were 0.2–22.2 km away from their natal territory during the first 3–12 months after fledging. An estimated 45% survived one year. Movements of dispersing American Crows varied in their consistency with simulated random-walk paths; the data suggested that, at the population level, American Crows were not drawn into urban areas, though some individuals may have been. Movements of dispersers produced a net influx into the city, because of greater reproductive success outside the city than in it. Simulations of urban population growth that included immigrants and emigrants accounted for most of the observed growth, which indicates the importance of distant suburban and exurban breeding pairs to urban population dynamics.\nLa Dispersión de Juveniles de Corvus brachyrhynchos Influencia la Dinámica Poblacional a lo Largo de un Gradiente de Urbanización","author":[{"family":"Withey","given":"John"},{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"witheyDispersalJuvenileAmerican2005","container-title":"The Auk","container-title-short":"The Auk","DOI":"10.1093/auk/122.1.205","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,1]]},"page":"205-221","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Dispersal by juvenile American crows influences population dynamics across a gradient of urbanization","type":"article-journal","volume":"122"},

American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), one such exploiter, create concern due to their impact as nest predators, disease hosts, and cultural harbingers of evil. We used various measures of crow abundance and resource use to determine crows’ response to features of anthropogenic landscapes in the Puget Sound region of the United States. We examined land cover and land use composition at three spatial scales: study sites (up to 208 ha), crow home ranges within sites (18.1 ha), and local land cover (400 m2). At the study site and within-site scales crow abundance was strongly correlated with land cover providing anthropogenic resources. In particular, crows were associated with the amount of ‘maintained forest’ cover, and were more likely to use grass and shrub cover than forest or bare soil cover. Although crows did not show a generalized response to an edge variable, they exhibited greater use of patchy habitat created by human settlements than of native forests. Radio-tagged territorial adults used resources within their home ranges relatively evenly, suggesting resource selection had occurred at a larger spatial scale. The land conversion pattern of new suburban and exurban settlements creates the mix of impervious surfaces and maintained vegetation that crows use, and in our study area crow populations are expected to continue to increase.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Withey","given":"John C."},{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."}],"citation-key":"witheyMultiscaleUseLands2009","container-title":"Landscape Ecology","container-title-short":"Landscape Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/s10980-008-9305-9","ISSN":"0921-2973, 1572-9761","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",2]]},"language":"en","page":"281-293","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Multi-scale use of lands providing anthropogenic resources by American Crows in an urbanizing landscape","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-008-9305-9","volume":"24"},

Bioinspiration and biohybridization have led to new, exciting research, but humans have relied on biotic materials—non-living materials derived from living organisms—since their early ancestors wore animal hides as clothing and used bones for tools. In this work, an inanimate spider is repurposed as a ready-to-use actuator requiring only a single facile fabrication step, initiating the area of “necrobotics” in which biotic materials are used as robotic components. The unique walking mechanism of spiders—relying on hydraulic pressure rather than antagonistic muscle pairs to extend their legs—results in a necrobotic gripper that naturally resides in its closed state and can be opened by applying pressure. The necrobotic gripper is capable of grasping objects with irregular geometries and up to 130% of its own mass. Furthermore, the gripper can serve as a handheld device and innately camouflages in outdoor environments. Necrobotics can be further extended to incorporate biotic materials derived from other creatures with similar hydraulic mechanisms for locomotion and articulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Yap","given":"Te Faye"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Rajappan","given":"Anoop"},{"family":"Shimokusu","given":"Trevor J."},{"family":"Preston","given":"Daniel J."}],"citation-key":"yap2022","container-title":"Advanced Science","DOI":"10.1002/advs.202201174","ISSN":"2198-3844","issue":"29","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 The Authors.

Time spent as a sentinel (perching and scanning from conspicuous locations within sight of the nest) increased with group size, but successful and depredated nests did not differ significantly in sentinel time, and sentinels did not appear to coordinate their vigilance. Both breeder and helper males acted as sentinels, and both were more vigilant when nests contained nestlings than when they contained eggs. Breeders with helpers spent more time as sentinels than those without helpers. Presence of a sentinel reduced the time feeding adults spent pausing to scan when approaching and leaving the nest. Thus, vigilance could enable a male to detect a predator and decoy it away from the nest site or prevent it from locating the nest by deferring feeding visits of other provisioners, but we could not demonstrate that it reduced nest predation by the major nest predator, the Pied Currawong (Strepera graculina).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Yasukawa","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Cockburn","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"yasukawaAntipredatorVigilanceCooperatively2009","container-title":"The Auk","container-title-short":"The Auk","DOI":"10.1525/auk.2009.08074","ISSN":"1938-4254","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1,1]]},"page":"147-154","source":"Silverchair","title":"Antipredator Vigilance in Cooperatively Breeding Superb Fairy-Wrens (<i>Malurus Cyaneus </i>)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1525/auk.2009.08074","volume":"126"},

Males engaged in such behaviour appear to be acting as sentinels, guarding their nests against predators. The sentinel hypothesis was tested in three ways. (1) Male response to a simulated predator was observed. On average, males spent significantly more time within 10 m of their nests following predator presentations than at other times during the same day, and many males looked into their nests immediately after the simulated predator was removed. (2) The height and distance distributions of putative sentinel perches near nests that successfully fledged young were compared with those near nests that failed as a result of predation. Successful nests were associated with significantly closer and higher perches than were depredated nests. (3) The effect of artificial sentinel perches on female choice of nest location in a prairie habitat lacking tall perches was observed. Females were more likely to place their nests in areas with nearby artificial perches than in similar areas lacking such perches. These results support the sentinel hypothesis.

We used hair dye to dull epaulets of free-living territorial males prior to pair formation to determine if manipulated males experienced disadvantages in comparison with control males. We found no differences between control males and males with dulled epaulets in territorial behavior (territory size, song rate, trespass rate, and loss of territory), paternal care (time spent on territory and in antipredator sentinel behavior, and response to a model crow to simulate the threat of predation), pairing success (number of social mates), apparent reproductive success (numbers of nesting attempts, eggs/nest, nestlings/egg, and ﬂedglings/nestling), or realized reproductive success (numbers of within-pair, extra-pair, and total ﬂedglings as determined by DNA ﬁngerprinting). We then used a meta-analysis of 11 published studies of Red-winged Blackbirds to determine if there is an overall effect of epaulet color or size on male-male competition, female choice, or reproductive success. Our results show that epaulet size has a small positive effect on male reproductive success, but epaulet color has no effect on male-male competition, female choice, and male reproductive success. One explanation for the seeming contradiction between studies that show that epaulets are necessary for territory defense and those that conclude that epaulets are not currently under selection is that epaulets serve as one of several cues of species recognition, especially among males at close range. An alternative explanation proposes counter-balancing intersexual advantages and intrasexual disadvantages of epaulet expression. Additional studies are needed to test these alternatives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Yasukawa","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Enstrom","given":"David A."},{"family":"Parker","given":"Patricia G."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Thomas C."}],"citation-key":"yasukawaMaleRedwingedBlackbirds2010","container-title":"Journal of Field Ornithology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1557-9263.2009.00258.x","ISSN":"02738570, 15579263","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",3]]},"language":"en","page":"31-41","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Male Red-winged Blackbirds with experimentally dulled epaulets experience no disadvantage in sexual selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1557-9263.2009.00258.x","volume":"81"},
  {"id":"yuan2021","abstract":"It has been commonly observed on open waters that ducklings/goslings follow their mothers in a highly organized formation. The questions arise: (1) why are they swimming in formation? (2) what is the best swimming formation? (3) how much energy can be preserved by each individual in formation swimming? To address these questions, we established a simplified mathematical and numerical model and calculated the wave drag on a group of waterfowl in a swimming formation. We observed two new and interesting findings: wave-riding and wave-passing. By riding the waves generated by a mother duck, a trailing duckling can obtain a significant wave-drag reduction. When a duckling swims at the ‘sweet point’ behind its mother, a destructive wave interference phenomenon occurs and the wave drag of the duckling turns positive, pushing the duckling forward. More interestingly, this wave-riding benefit could be sustained by the rest of the ducklings in a single-file line formation. Starting from the third one in a queue, the wave drag of individuals gradually tended towards zero, and a delicate dynamic equilibrium was achieved. Each individual under that equilibrium acted as a wave passer, passing the waves’ energy to its trailing one without any energy losses. Wave-riding and wave-passing are probably the principal reasons for the evolution of swimming formation by waterfowl. This study is the first to reveal the reasons why the formation movement of waterfowl can preserve individuals’ energy expenditure. Our calculations provide new insights into the mechanisms of formation swimming.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"Zhi-Ming"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Minglu"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Laibing"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Chunyan"},{"family":"Incecik","given":"Atilla"}],"citation-key":"yuan2021","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/jfm.2021.820","ISSN":"0022-1120, 1469-7645","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"R2","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Wave-riding and wave-passing by ducklings in formation swimming","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/waveriding-and-wavepassing-by-ducklings-in-formation-swimming/94759A0FF7070D9D7CAC5907594B1781","volume":"928"},

Individuals play public goods games within their groups using conditional strategies, which are represented as piecewise linear response functions. Accordingly, groups engage in conflicts with a certain probability. In contrast to previous studies, we consider continuous contribution levels and a rich set of conditional strategies, allowing for a wide range of possible interactions between strategies. We find that the existence of conditional strategies enables the stabilization of cooperation even under strong intra-group selection. The strategy that eventually dominates in the population has two key properties: (i) It is unexploitable with strong intra-group selection; (ii) It can achieve full contribution to outperform other strategies in the inter-group selection. The success of this strategy is robust to initial conditions as well as changes to important parameters. We also investigate the influence of different factors on cooperation levels, including group conflicts, group size and migration rate. Their effect on cooperation can be attributed to and explained by their influence on the relative strength of intra-group and inter-group selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Huanren"},{"family":"Perc","given":"Matjaž"}],"citation-key":"zhang2016","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep23006","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,11]]},"language":"en","license":"2016 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"23006","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Evolution of conditional cooperation under multilevel selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep23006","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"zunigaMigrationConfersWinter2017","abstract":"To evolve and to be maintained, seasonal migration, despite its risks, has to yield fitness benefits compared with year-round residency. Empirical data supporting this prediction have remained elusive in the bird literature. To test fitness related benefits of migration, we studied a partial migratory population of European blackbirds (Turdus merula) over 7 years. Using a combination of capture-mark-recapture and radio telemetry, we compared survival probabilities between migrants and residents estimated by multi-event survival models, showing that migrant blackbirds had 16% higher probability to survive the winter compared to residents. A subsequent modelling exercise revealed that residents should have 61.25% higher breeding success than migrants, to outweigh the survival costs of residency. Our results support theoretical models that migration should confer survival benefits to evolve, and thus provide empirical evidence to understand the evolution and maintenance of migration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Zúñiga","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Gager","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Kokko","given":"Hanna"},{"family":"Fudickar","given":"Adam Michael"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Naef-Daenzer","given":"Beat"},{"family":"Wikelski","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Partecke","given":"Jesko"}],"citation-key":"zunigaMigrationConfersWinter2017","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.28123","editor":[{"family":"Helm","given":"Barbara"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,21]]},"page":"e28123","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"Migration confers winter survival benefits in a partially migratory songbird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28123","volume":"6"}
